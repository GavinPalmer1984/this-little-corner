For dia logos the reinventio is to bring argumentation in, but not as a logical sequence of propositions, but as a series of proposals within logos, i.e., proposals that gather together so that they come to belong together in the mutual affordance of a new disclosure of reality. The reinventio of virtue is to see it as the beauty of wisdom.\n\nHere is Andrew's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/andrewsweenymusic\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of
