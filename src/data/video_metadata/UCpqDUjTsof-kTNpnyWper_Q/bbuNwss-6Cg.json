Gregg and I discuss how this theory is actually a theory of information complexification that affords  making sense of situations, i.e., it converges with the previous theories in holding that consciousness emerges from relevance realization and functions to enhance relevance realization. In this way Integrated Information Theory about the nature of consciousness can be integrated with Global Workspace about the function of consciousness in order to give a more complete account. Gregg then begins the process of integrated this proposal into his overarching framework.", "duration": 4729, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "welcome to untangling the world knot of", "start": 0.88,
