He is a facilitator for circling and he is running experiments with circling groups in  which he introduces a problem for discussing within an active circle. Taylor and I discuss his sequence of experiments, and what he has learned so far. We then compare his project to  the dialectic-dialogos project and explore ways in which the projects converge and could be integrated.\n\nHere is the link to Authentic Relating Toronto.
