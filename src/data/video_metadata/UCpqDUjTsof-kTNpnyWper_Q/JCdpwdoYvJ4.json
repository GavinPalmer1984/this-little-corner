Here we lay out the beginnings of how to formulate the problem. The problem of consciousness is actually made up of three problems:\n\n1)  The function problem: what does consciousness do?\n2) The nature/generation problem: how something like consciousness fit into the scientific worldview?\n3)  The integration problem: what is the relationship between the answers to questions (1) and (2)?\n\nGregg and I are going to spend a lot of time in formulating these problems clearly through historical, phenomenological, and functional analysis before responding to them.\n\nIn this episode we continue the task of formulating the problem by looking at two more of Descartes key arguments including the debate with Hobbes. We also investigate Descartes attempts to answer the nature and function problems in an integrated manner and the connections he draws between intelligence, consciousness and reason. \n\nThank you for your support!", "duration": 3980, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "welcome to untangling the world knot of", "start": 0.88, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "consciousness", "start": 3.04, "duration": 3.759},
