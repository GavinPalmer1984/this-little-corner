Lewis to advance a case for the possibility of miracles. Paul Vanderklay has a long standing interest in Lewis' book on miracles. I argue that a naturalistic neoplatonism opens up to the extraordinary but precludes the need for supernatural miracles, but this leads to the discussion whether miracles are supernatural.  I loved participating in this wonderful dia logos. \n\nPaul's channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/paulvanderklay\nJP's channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzlvx0HHYiPOJTEOU399WA",
