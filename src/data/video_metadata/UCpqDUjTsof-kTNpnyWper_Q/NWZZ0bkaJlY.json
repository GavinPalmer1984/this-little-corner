In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nHere is the playlist for this Meditating with John Vervaeke series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VuhdS9IL92M2jLmzAo3dHkJT\n\nMondays and Thursdays are slightly longer lesson days, with a 15 minute sit and time for questions. Tue, Wed, Fri, & Sat are 15 minute sits with time for questions.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke",
