 "description": "The Discord server is here: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv\n\nI met Tyler as facilitator on my Discord server. He also curates and facilitates on Eric Weinstein\"s and Lex Fridman's Discords.  He has some powerful insights about the role of the Discord technology and communities for affording dialogos and the Religion That is not a Religion.\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke",
