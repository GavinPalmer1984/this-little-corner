This helps to make clear what a metapsychology is and why it is needed for adequate understanding of transformation. Zak then takes us into the work of Pierce and especially a more in depth understanding of Piaget to make clear what is at stake in trying to truly understand development.\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
