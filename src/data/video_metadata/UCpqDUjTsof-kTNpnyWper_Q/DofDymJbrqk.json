 "description": "Anderson Todd is a cognitive scientist and a practicing Psychotherapist. He also teaches courses at the University of Toronto on Jung.\n\nIn this wide-ranging discussion we explore deep connections between Jungian theory and practice and cognitive science theory and practice. \n\nHere is a link to his online lecture about alchemy https://youtu.be/S-rxriHHLqI\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke",
