 "description": "Here are the five promises:\n- I promise not to harm but to mindfully enhance and enrich life. \n- I promise not to relate to material things mindlessly but mindfully (remember the being mode)\n- I promise not to speak mindlessly but mindfully. \n- I promise not to practice sexuality mindlessly but mindfully. \n- I promise not to cultivate altered states of consciousness mindlessly but mindfully. ( for the sake of wisdom not for escape).\n\nPlease join me for a daily meditation live stream every weekday at 09:30 AM EST. In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nHere is the playlist for this Meditating with John Vervaeke series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VuhdS9IL92M2jLmzAo3dHkJT\n\nMondays are slightly longer with a lesson, 15 minute sit, and time for questions. Tuesdays to Fridays are 15 minute sits with time for questions.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke",
