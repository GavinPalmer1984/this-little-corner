 "description": "J.P. has been working with Jonathan Pageau and is now the editor-in-chief for the Symbolic World blog. J.P. and I have had several enriching conversations with each other as well as with Mary Kochan. Here J.P. and I get into genuine dialogos about what symbolism is, its necessary connection to philia sophia, what the features of powerful symbolism are, and what the features of good symbolism are. We also address the question: what does this have to do with religion and Christianity?\n\nHere is the link to Symbolic World blog: https://thesymbolicworld.com/content/articles/\nHere is the link to the article by J.P. on cell tower arson:  https://thesymbolicworld.com/articles/the-symbolism-of-cell-tower-arson/\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
