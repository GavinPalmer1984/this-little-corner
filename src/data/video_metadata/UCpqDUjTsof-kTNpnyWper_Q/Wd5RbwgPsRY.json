 "description": "Thank you for joining my Q&A. A few notes:\n1. It starts just after 1500 EST and lasts for approximately an hour.\n\n2. The first ~45 minutes are previously submitted questions and the last ~15 minutes are questions from the live discussion chat.\n\n3. Patrons get priority question-asking access and have submitted questions ahead of time. Please identify yourself as a Patron in the chat if you'd like to ask a live question. You can get priority question-asking access for $2/month here, as well as other benefits including a video chat with me: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\n4. Please be respectful in your interactions with each other and with me, so we can focus on solutions to the Meaning Crisis.",
