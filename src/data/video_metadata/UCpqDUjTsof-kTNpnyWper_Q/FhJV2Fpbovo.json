We talk about trust, faith, meeting in good faith, and dealing with those threatening trust by acting in bad faith.\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here:
