 "description": "Gregg Henriques and I review his work and recent convergent work from Sperber and Mercier on how reason evolved within, and functions best within the cultural system of distributed cognition and extended mind. We also explore how this connects reason to self-awareness, Socratic dialectic, and religion. \n\nKey works:\nhttps://www.gregghenriques.com/uploads/2/4/3/6/24368778/unifiedtheory.pdf\nhttps://www.gregghenriques.com/uploads/2/4/3/6/24368778/the_justification_hypothesis.pdf\n\nWorks on Justification Hypothesis by others authors\nhttps://www.gregghenriques.com/uploads/2/4/3/6/24368778/mirror_self_recognition.pdf\nhttps://www.gregghenriques.com/uploads/2/4/3/6/24368778/remythologyzing_culture.pdf\n\nSome blogs on Theory of Knowledge\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201812/the-jh-just-why-name-change-is-justified\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202002/what-is-the-mental-organ-justification\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201710/our-two-essences-modern-humans-primates-and-persons\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201804/the-human-mind-informational-interface-approach\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201910/the-reason-reason\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
