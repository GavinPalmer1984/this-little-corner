 "description": "Curious about Anderson Todd? Join his live Q&A Friday Feb 7th, 2020 at 1500 EST here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsUquRO-70w\n\nHas Jordan Peterson misinterpreted the Jungian concept of the shadow? Find out the answer to this and more, in a sweeping discussion which addresses such topics as:\n\n- How Star Wars is post-Jungian\n- The relationship between Job and the Joker\n- Jung's controversial relationship to Naziism\n- Whether our society treats the Hero's Journey like crack cocaine\n\n\n...and much more, John Vervaeke and Anderson Todd dive deep into the collective psyche, and unearth some wisdom and insights along the way.\n\n\nFor more on Jung check out John Vervaeke's discussion of Corbin and Jung in Awakening from the Meaning Crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkykBqApP4A\n\n\nCREDITS\nDiscussion by John Vervaeke and Anderson Todd\nVideo produced and edited by Arielle Friedman\nGraphics by Katy Kelly\n\nSound Engineering by Chris Guida\nQuality control by Katy Kelly",
