 "description": "This is my second dialogos with James.  This is a very careful presentation by James of the fundamental problems facing the cultivation of meaning and responsibility.  Both James and I agree that this video is an improvement on his first video with me which was already very good.  We get into the three transcendentals: the true, the good, and the beautiful. This is such a rich and rigorous discussion.\n\nJames'  book can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenological-Revision-Dialectical-Perspectives-Philosophy/dp/3030650286/ref=sr_1_2?crid=PTBX9139LW0J&dchild=1&keywords=dialectical+holism&qid=1633780986&sprefix=dialectical+h%2Caps%2C150&sr=8-2\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis. You can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke \n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
