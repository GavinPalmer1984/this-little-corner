 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7XJFhWK2LM",
 "date": "2020-03-29",
 "description": "Andrew and I discuss how rationality is different from both logic and intelligence, and how it has more to do with the systematic and reliable overcoming of self-deception and the affording of enhanced meaning in life. This is a notion of rationality that overlaps with wisdom.\n\nHere is the link to Andrew's channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/andrewsweenymusic\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.",
