 "description": "Esther is a philosopher who, like me, has been very influenced by Polanyi and D.C. Schindler. She has worked very hard to both draw the deep importance of these thinkers and to make their work very accessible to non-philosophers. Esther and I converge on a lot of points and it was so great to talk to her.\n\nHere is Esther's website http://www.estherlightcapmeek.com/",
