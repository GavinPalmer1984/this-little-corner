You will get lifetime access to all course materials, as well as access to the Halkyon forum, where you can get in touch with your peers from the course and join the reading groups within the Halkyon forum.\n\nYou will find more information about the course and how to enroll via this link: https://halkyonacademy.teachable.com/p/nishitani-religion-and-nothingness/\n\n\nFor more information and more content you can also check out the Youtube channels of Daniel and Johannes:\nDaniel\u2019s channel: https://youtube.com/user/zappzapp00\nJohannes\u2019 channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsQqlrzoc-K32DE-Wh-roA\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
