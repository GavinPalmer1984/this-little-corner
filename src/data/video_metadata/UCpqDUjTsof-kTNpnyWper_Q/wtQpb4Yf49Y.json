Paul on transformative experience and the work of Agnes Callard on aspiration, provides a better model. In fact, Rachel argues that for her the gender transition project sits within the more important Socratic project of the cultivation of wisdom. Becoming a sage is more of a transformative experience than changing gender. The two forms of transformative experience can talk to  and enable each other. Towards that end Rachel is also involved in the process of transforming a martial arts ecology of practices into a wisdom cultivation ecology of practices that she can she with other martial artists.\n\nLInk to Rachel's martial arts-wisdom project:  bodydharmamartialarts@gmail.com\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
