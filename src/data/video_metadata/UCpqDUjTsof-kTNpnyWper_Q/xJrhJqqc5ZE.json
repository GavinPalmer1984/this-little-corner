In 2015, he founded the Mapping the Mind conference, which raises much needed funds for psychedelic research. Daniel regularly hosts lectures and workshops on topics in cognitive science. He is currently writing a book with Dr. John Vervaeke on the science of enlightenment, which will be published in 2020.
