Mark has made use of that as well as some of my work on mindfulness to recently do experimental and theoretical work on people going through an experience of no self.  Mark distinguished between a pathological version as in depersonalization and self-transcendence that can be conducive to the cultivation of meaning. \n\nSee the Cognitive Science Show series on the nature and function of the self. :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fnmp6UVafM&t=649s\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
