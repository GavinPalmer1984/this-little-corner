With Zevi's critical help I advance an argument to show how and why it is rationally  justifiable for people to seek out these states and be seekers of unity. \n\nHere is Zevi's channel Seekers of Unity:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL9A83sJIYNAovCA92uaTRQ\n\nHere is round one of the series: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vN0TYleG14&t=908s\n\nHere is round two:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-x4LFV_PfU&t=218s\n\nHere is round three:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx63NiNsB_0&t=955s\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
