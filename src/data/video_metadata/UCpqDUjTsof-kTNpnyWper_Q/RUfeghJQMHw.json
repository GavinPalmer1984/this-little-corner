In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nHere is the playlist for the lessons in this Meditating with John Vervaeke series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nMondays are slightly longer with a lesson, 15 minute sit, and time for questions. Tuesdays to Fridays are 15 minute sits with time for questions.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nPlease join the Discord server to discuss my work with others: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
