Enlightenment is all about optimal and ethical relationships between self, world, and other. The \"cognitive continuum\" refers to a set of neurocognitive functions, starting in insight, and culminating in the experience of mystical union. We argue that the optimal grip on reality that is characteristic of enlightenment is cultivated by using a set of practices that train this continuum of functions. The result of this training is a flexible and dynamic state of being infused with a sense of meaningfulness and connection. We will weave together the teachings of the world\u2019s traditions of religion and philosophy with research based cognitive science to create this framework. This book will feature three parts:\n \nPart I: Heaven - Illuminates the philosophy behind enlightenment\nPart 2: Earth - Illuminates the science behind enlightenment\nPart 3: The Way - Provides personal and social guidelines for the cultivation of enlightenment\n \n \nDaniel Greig:\n \nDaniel is an educator, organizer and artist living in Toronto. He studied Cognitive Science and Philosophy at the University of Toronto, specializing in wisdom, consciousness, and spiritual belief and experience. In 2015, he founded the Mapping the Mind conference, which raises much needed funds for psychedelic research. Daniel regularly hosts lectures and workshops on topics in cognitive science. He is currently writing a book with Dr. John Vervaeke on the science of enlightenment, which will be published in 2020. When not contemplating the realm of the intellect, Daniel delves in the sonic perturbations of music, writing and producing progressive metal.
