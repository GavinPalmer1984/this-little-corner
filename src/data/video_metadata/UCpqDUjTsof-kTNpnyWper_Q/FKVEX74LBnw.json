 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKVEX74LBnw",
 "date": "2020-05-01",
 "description": "Zac, Andrew and I have a rich discussion  about finding the logos within a turning point in the culture and its connections to what religion and/or faith could mean for us now.\n\nZac Stein has written an online essay about the covid crisis and the deep changes it is driving in the culture. The essay is gaining a lot of recognition. Herein  Zac, Andrew and I discuss the issues addressed and raised by his powerful essay about meaning, mythopoetic language, the religion that is not a religion, the meaning crisis, and above all else the need for deep educational reform.\n\nHere is the link to Zac's essay  http://www.whatisemerging.com/opinions/covid-19-a-war-broke-out-in-heaven\nHere is the link to Andrew's channel  https://www.youtube.com/user/andrewsweenymusic\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke",
