 "description": "Notes:\nBooks referenced:\nThe Enlightened Heart by Stephen Mitchell \nThe Enlightened Mind by Stephen Mitchell\nSacred Reading by Michael Casey\nLectio Divina by Basil Pennington\nLadder of Monks and twelve meditations by Guigo Ii \nReverence by Paul Woodruff \nLiving Theurgia by Jeffrey Kupperman\nThe wisdom of Hypatia by Bruce MacLennan\nPerennial philosophy by Arthur Verslius\nPlatonic Mysticism by Arthur Verslius \nThe experience of insight by Joseph Goldstein\nSeeking the heart of wisdom by Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield. \nInsight Meditation by Joseph Goldstein. \n\nThe Four Es:\nEnactive engagement: set the intention for reverence and transformation. Recite the text and note what jumps out, grabs your attention and resonances with you. \n\nEmbodied emotion:  allow emotional associations to come up as you imaginally enact the imagery. \n\nExistential-ethics:   What would it would be like to see and be this way as a way of life? \n\nEkstatic-eternal:  what is being disclosed about Being or the world and what correspondingly is being demanded from you called from you in order to come into conformity with this realization. This is the call and path of transformation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPlease join me for a daily meditation sit + Q&As every weekday at 09:30 AM EST. In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nHere is the playlist for the lessons in this Meditating with John Vervaeke series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nEvery other Monday, we add an advanced lesson, now that the introductory course is finished.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nPlease join the Discord server to discuss my work with others: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
