However, though we respect wise people, we don't know what wisdom is. John Vervaeke, PhD offers a cognitive science theory of wisdom in this engaging talk and offers his contribution to the world. He summarizes his extremely popular \"Higher Cognitive Processes\" (PSY371) course on the psychology of wisdom at the University of Toronto as: \"wisdom is rationally self-transcending rationality\".\n\nPlease subscribe so you can find out about new videos!
