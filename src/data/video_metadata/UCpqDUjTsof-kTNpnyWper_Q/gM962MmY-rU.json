In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress. \n\nEvery other Monday, we add an advanced lesson, now that the introductory course is finished.\n\nIf you have just found me, watch the first lesson in this playlist of all the lessons, then start joining my daily live stream and then watch a new lesson every Sat or Sun until you are caught up to us:
