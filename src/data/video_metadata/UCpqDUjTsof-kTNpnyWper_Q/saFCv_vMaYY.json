In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nPlease note I had a Meniere's attack, which causes extreme nausea, towards the end of the 15 minutes. As I came out of my meditation and shifted position, there is some noise on the audio track, which may distract you.\n\nFeel free to set a 15 minute timer and pause the video when I say \"Let's begin\" so you have an uninterrupted 15 minutes.\n\nHere's the link to the last lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsE_XxfFQ0w&list=PLND1JCRq8VuhdS9IL92M2jLmzAo3dHkJT&index=4\n\nMondays and Thursdays are slightly longer lesson days, with a 15 minute sit and time for questions. Tue, Wed, Fri, & Sat are 15 minute sits with time for questions.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke", "duration": 1331, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "you", "start": 0.0, "duration": 2.06}, {"text": "co\u00f1o I study
