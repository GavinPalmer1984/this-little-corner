Anna reached out to me because she saw deep convergence between her work on mine. This work has important implications for economics, moral theory,, the cultivation of wisdom,  and our very self-definition as human beings.\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.
