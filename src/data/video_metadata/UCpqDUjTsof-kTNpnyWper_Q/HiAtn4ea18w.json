 "description": "This is a video of a conference talk I gave pointing out the deep difficulties in trying to understand psychological growth especially as constituted by processes of transformation and aspiration. So while we talk a lot about growth, getting clear about it requires some important conceptual work.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
