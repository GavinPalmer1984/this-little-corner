 "date": "2013-02-19",
 "description": "John Vervaeke, PhD teaches a course called Buddhism and Cognitive Science (NEW333) which includes a lot on how and why people find meaning in life. In this entertaining off-the-cuff talk, he argues the reason why zombies are so huge in the media right now is because they are a symbol of the lack of meaning that many of us feel in our hectic and disconnected modern lives.\n\nPlease subscribe so you can find out about new videos!
