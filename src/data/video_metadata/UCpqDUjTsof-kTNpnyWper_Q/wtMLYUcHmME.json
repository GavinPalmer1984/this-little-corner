 "description": "Part 2/2 of a rich dialogue with Guy and Johannes about nihilism and the meaning crisis from a Heideggerian perspective and the contrast between academic philosophy and ancient philia sophia (the love and cultivation of wisdom). Also, an exploration of the relation between the love of wisdom and dia logos (authentic dialogue open to emergence).\n\nThis is part of my discussion series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis.\n\nHere is the link to Guy Sengstock's channel   https://www.youtube.com/user/82472tclt\n\nHere is the link to Johannes Niederhauser's channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsQqlrzoc-K32DE-Wh-roA/featured",
