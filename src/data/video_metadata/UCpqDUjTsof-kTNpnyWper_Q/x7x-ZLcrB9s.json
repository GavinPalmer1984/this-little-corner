teaching meditation for decades.\n\nIf you have just found me, watch the first lesson in this playlist, then start joining the daily live stream every weekday at 9:30 AM at the discord server linked below, and watch a new lesson every Sat or Sun until you have caught up to us: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the
