Johannes and I have spoken before and here he brings his deep knowledge of Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Plato into the depths of this dialogos.  Here is Johannes' channel:  https://www.youtube.com/c/ClassicalPhilosophy\n\n\nDanial Zaruba is also a public philosopher who teaches a non-academic course on Nishitani and his masterpiece, Religion and Nothingness. Daniel and I have spoken before.  Daniel brings his deep reading of Nishitani and the Kyoto school into the depths of this dialogos.\n\nTogether we emerge and unfold a way of seeing and being that will allow us to recover and live out a Socratic Platonic way of being in the world. This is a way that reconnects meaning, intelligibility, and reality and thereby address nihilism.\n\nThis is part 1 of a planned series of videos.", "duration": 4565, "transcript_parts": [{"text":
