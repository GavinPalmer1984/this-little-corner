We also explore how this deep appreciation of transformation has significant implications for education and our understanding of human spirituality.  This series is a follow up to two earlier series, Untangling the Worldknot of Consciousness,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD6Szbf1cHo&t=91s ,  and The Elusive I:  The Nature and Function of the Self, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fnmp6UVafM&t=647s ,  but it can also be watched as a stand alone series.\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke \n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work:
