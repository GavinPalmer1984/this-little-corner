 "date": "2021-09-04",
 "description": "In this episode we explore the debate between Buber and Jung as a way of deepening the articulation of the relationship between the dialogical-existential  dimension and the psychological-individual dimension.  This in turns helps us to deepen the relation between the dialogical and the mystical. \n\n\nThis is part of my series Voices with Vervaeke: Science, Spirituality, and the Meaning Crisis. You can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke \n\nJoin the Discord Server to discuss and reflect upon my work: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
