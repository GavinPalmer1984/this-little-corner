In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress. \n\nEvery other Monday, we add an advanced lesson, now that the introductory course is finished.\n\nIf you have just found me, watch the first lesson in this playlist, then start joining my daily live stream every weekday, and watch a new lesson every Sat or Sun until you have caught up to us: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nPlease join the Discord server to discuss my work with others: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv", "duration": 1459,
