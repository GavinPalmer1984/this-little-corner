 "description": "Mary and I discuss her proposal for a fifth kind of knowing, we then shift to the discussion of innate knowledge, humans as ontological mediators, reformulating Christian symbols beyond the two world mythology, and child development within the religion that is not a religion. As always, it was a delightful and rich conversation with Mary and her insightful mind, playful spirit, and deep respect for deep dialogue.\n\nHere is the link to Mary's channel where you can see previous conversations between Mary, myself, and JP Marceau as well as several videos in which Mary comments on my work from a Christian perspective.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2leFZRD0ZlQDQxpR2Zd8oA",
