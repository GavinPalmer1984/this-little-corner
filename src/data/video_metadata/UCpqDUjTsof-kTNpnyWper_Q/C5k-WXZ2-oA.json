 "description": "Please join me for a daily 15-minute meditation sit + Q&As every weekday at 09:30 AM EST. In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nI am a cognitive scientist and Associate Professor at the University of Toronto, and I have been practicing and teaching meditation for decades.\n\nOn Mondays, we alternate a new advanced lesson (Dharma Day) and a full review (Upaya Day).\n\nIf you have just found me, watch the first lesson in this playlist, then start joining my daily live stream every weekday, and watch a new lesson every Sat or Sun until you have caught up to us: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nPlease join the Discord server to discuss my work with others: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv",
