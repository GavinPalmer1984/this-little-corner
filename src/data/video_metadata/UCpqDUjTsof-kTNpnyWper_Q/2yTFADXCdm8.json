In these challenging times, meditation can help ground us and cope with stress.\n\nI am a cognitive scientist and Associate Professor at the University of Toronto, and I have been practicing and teaching meditation for decades.\n\nIf you have just found me, watch the first lesson in this playlist, then start joining the daily live stream every weekday at 9:30 AM at the discord server linked below, and watch a new lesson every Sat or Sun until you have caught up to us: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3\n\nYou can support my work on Patreon, with the proceeds going into the research I do at the University of Toronto on the Meaning Crisis and the cultivation of wisdom here: https://www.patreon.com/johnvervaeke\n\nPlease join the Discord server for a daily meditation group sit, and to discuss my work with others: https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv\n\nLink to the talk on the view from above:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5iGCW3fDb4&t=2524s\n\nBooks
