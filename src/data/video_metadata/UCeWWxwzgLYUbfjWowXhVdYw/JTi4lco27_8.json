 "description": "Are \"Judaeo Christian\" values the sole reason the West advanced in history? I think not. I discuss my thought, prompted by call tweeted out by Ben Shapiro during the burning of Notre Dame. I ended up engaging in a discussion with Grievance Studies scholar James Lindsay on this subject with his own concerns, and the result is this video with my musings on the matter.\n\nArticle I reference on the history of the term \"Judaeo-Christian\"\nhttps://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/distinctly-catholic/mark-silk-history-term-judeo-christian\n\nFollow me here:\ntwitter: @theother_95\nInstagram: @theother95\nFacebook: @theother95page\nEmail me: theotherninetyfive@gmail.com",
