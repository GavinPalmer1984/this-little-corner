 "date": "2021-12-22",
 "description": "I speak with musician and filmmaker Neil DeGraide about his film Queen of The Night. It is such a beautifully made film and I hope that all who watch this interview also go and check it out. We focus in on the aspects of the feminine used in his story, and contrast them with how things are done today. This was such a fun chat, and I encourage you to check out Neil's fantastic band that he and his wife are part of called @Dirt Poor Robins . They produce and perform all of the music for \"Queen of the Night\" as well. \n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://anchor.fm/podcast-9b57fe4/episodes/Rediscovery-of-the-Feminine-in-Storytelling-with-Neil-DeGraide-e1c2l00\n\nThe first episode of Queen of the Night: https://youtu.be/X_GugZS1pqQ\n\nNeil's band's website: https://www.dirtpoorrobins.com\n\nfollow me on twitter @andrealynnlewis\nemail me at andreawiththebangs@gmail.com\nfollow my vintage Instagram @fringevintagefinds",
