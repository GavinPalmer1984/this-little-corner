248.079, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "got me so interested in it just it just", "start": 250.03, "duration": 4.53}, {"text": "really radically changed my worldview", "start": 252.459, "duration":

you", "start": 266.62, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "have you out you have your PhD right I", "start": 268.66, "duration": 6.45}, {"text": "do yeah okay and what is your last year", "start": 271.78,

at what they call Fitness", "start": 380.979, "duration": 3.901}, {"text": "proxies so not measuring Fitness", "start": 383.08, "duration": 3.559}, {"text": "directly is in terms of how many",
