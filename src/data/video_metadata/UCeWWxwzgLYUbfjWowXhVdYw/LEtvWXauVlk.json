 "description": "I have been a fan of the Intellectual Dark Web since I first heard of them over a year ago. I liked what they had to say about free speech, and found they brought a voice to the silent majority. I saw Matt critique not just them but other ideas that I just took as fact, and I found his arguments to be well thought out. I found his tweets helped me to think more critically about why I believed something.  I was curious about his perspective, and I wanted to understand his position better. Though we question and disagree with one another throughout this interview, he shed light on his point of view, and we still walk away as friends, seeing that there is nothing wrong with questioning ideas, which is what dialogue is all about. I really enjoyed talking with him\n\nFollow him on twitter @RougeNotary \n\nFollow me here:\n\ntwitter: @theother_95\nInstagram: @theother95\nFacebook: @theother95page\nemail: theotherninetyfive@gmail.com",
