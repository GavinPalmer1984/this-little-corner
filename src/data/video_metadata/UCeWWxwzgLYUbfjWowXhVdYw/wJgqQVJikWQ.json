 "description": "The topic of today's discussion is the intimacy crises. I have the chance to speak with Mark Lefebvre on the subject. This is one of my lengthier interviews, but I decided to leave it as is because this is such a rich topic that I have never seen looked at before. I gained quite a bit of understanding and appreciate that Mark took the time to dive into this topic with me\n\nCheck out Mark's YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/NavigatingPatterns/featured\n\nfollow me on twitter @andrealynnlewis\nemail me at andreawiththebangs@gmail.com\nfollow my vintage Instagram @fringevintagefinds",
