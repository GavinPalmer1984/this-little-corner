 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGpEagZHiv0",
 "date": "2021-03-01",
 "description": "I speak with Rebecca about an article she recently wrote about the book \"How to be an Antiracist\" by Ibram X Kendi. By the title of the article, you can see that Rebecca is advocating for actually reading the source material rather than making judgements based on quotes pulled out of context. You may still disagree with the material post read...but at least you will be well informed in that disagreement \n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://anchor.fm/podcast-9b57fe4/episodes/On-Ibram-Kendi-A-Perspective-by-Rebecca-Christiansen-ev8kd1\n\nRebecca's article: https://girlchild.substack.com/p/in-defence-of-reading-the-damn-book\n\nLink to her substack: https://girlchild.substack.com\n\nFollow me on twitter @AndreaLynnLewis\nemail me at andreawiththebangs@gmail.com",
