We speak about liberty, freedom and virtue as seen in the ancient world, contrasted with modern definitions. We also touch on the tension between logos and mythos, and what this tension looks like. Steven often says in the interview that I am being somewhat reductionists when I summarize his points back to him, but I needed to to comprehend these ideas! This was a great one guys, I am looking forward to hearing what you all think\n\nFollow me here:twitter: @theother_95\nInstagram: @theother95\nFacebook: @theother95page\nEmail me:
