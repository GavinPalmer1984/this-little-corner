 "date": "2019-05-08",
 "description": "The phrase \"Intellectual Dark Web,\" or IDW was coined 1year ago today. I spoke Jonathan Kay, the editor of the Canadian division of Quillette magazine about his latest article on the subject. Kay describes the IDW as a set of values and ideas, and that one of the highest values of IDW thinkers is a sensitivity of being told what to think. I found this conversation to be insightful and I rather enjoyed hearing his perspective\n\nHere is Jon's article: https://arcdigital.media/the-intellectual-dark-web-is-a-year-old-do-we-know-what-it-is-yet-7a8dd3d6d06a\n\nFollow him on twitter @jonkay\n\nFollow me here:\ntwitter: @theother_95\nInstagram: @theother95\nFacebook: @theother95page\nEmail me: theotherninetyfive@gmail.com",
