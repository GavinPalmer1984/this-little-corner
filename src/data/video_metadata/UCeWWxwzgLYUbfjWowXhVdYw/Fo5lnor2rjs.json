This is not to be considered medical advice. It is simply his personal experience. Gallbladder disease is a serious issue that can lead to dangerous complications, including infection, and death, if left untreated. Any attempts to manage gallbladder disease through diet should be done under medical supervision. For many, too much damage has already been done, and the only option for treatment will be surgical removal.", "duration": 2885, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "[Music]", "start": 2.1, "duration":
