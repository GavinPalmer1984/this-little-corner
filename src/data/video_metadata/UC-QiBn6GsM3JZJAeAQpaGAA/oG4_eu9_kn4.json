 "description": "Scott Graves is a fellow Gardner-ite, head of SM Graves Associates, and hosts two very interesting podcasts, \"Are We Here Yet?,\" and \"Scotts on the Rocks\" about local business and politics. \n\nWe talked about the history of our country's financialization, the closing of once-thriving factories, the great skill and intelligence of everyday working people, and breaking the cycle of social and political disengagement. In the end, it was all about the life, death, and possibility of life again for small cities and towns like ours. \n\n00:30 \u2013 Introduction: A touring musician and looking for a sense of place\n16:32 \u2013 The bizarre, theatrical, crisis-ridden national scene\n24:28 \u2013 When the voters feel powerless\n29:00 \u2013 TheCommonToad confesses lifelong ignorance of local politics\n31:57 \u2013 The widespread cynicism of civic participation\n36:34 \u2013 The slow death of our mill towns: highly skilled citizens are abandoned by their industries\n43:35 \u2013 We take a moment to jeer at the Democratic party's snobbery towards working people\n52:59 \u2013 Scott explains the economics that bring small industrial cities to this moment\n1:05:59 \u2013 As the financial-ization of the economy progresses, what happens to workers in small cities and towns?\n1:11:46 \u2013 What strategies do communities have to fight back?\n1:21:05 \u2013 Provincial or parochial? Wendell Berry and loving your location\n1:32:05 \u2013 What is Scott working on now? Worcshop, \u201cAre we here yet?\u201d and a little Blues slips in...\n\nFor more links related to this conversation, visit: https://www.thecommontoad.com/single-post/conversations-scott-graves-went-to-the-crossroads-what-really-matters-in-our-towns-and-cities",
