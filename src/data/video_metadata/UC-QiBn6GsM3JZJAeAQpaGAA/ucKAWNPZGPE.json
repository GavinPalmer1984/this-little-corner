 "description": "Malcolm Guite is a poet, priest, scholar, songwriter, educator, and traveler-on-foot. He's the author of several books, including most recently Heaven in Ordinary, a collection of essays. \n\nDuring the Covid lockdown, Guite created a YouTube series called A Spell in the Library, in which the viewer is invited to join him in his home study for a drink, a chat, and a ramble through his dense and  beautiful collection of books.\n\nAnd Mr. Guite delighted TheCommonToad by agreeing to drop by the podcast the other day and...well...have a drink, a chat, and a ramble through the bookshelves. We talked about poetry, song, Leonard Cohen, Tolkien, C.S. Lewis & the Inklings, Malcolm's recent pilgrimage, and more. \n\n1:32 \u2013 We toast to Malcolm Guite's new book, Heaven in Ordinary\n2:54 \u2013 A Spell in the Library\n4:58 \u2013 Malcolm: \u201cpoetry precedes literacy,\u201d and the poem-song connection\n14:08 \u2013 Where to start with poetry\n26:45 \u2013 Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and the Inklings were looking forward, not backward\n37:57 \u2013 Belief, agnosticism, and Leonard Cohen\n49:34 \u2013 Diagnosing and tending to our era's crisis of meaning\n58:29 \u2013  \u2026 while avoiding mere nostalgia for the past\n1:06:36 \u2013 Traveling on foot, and Malcolm's recent pilgrimage",
