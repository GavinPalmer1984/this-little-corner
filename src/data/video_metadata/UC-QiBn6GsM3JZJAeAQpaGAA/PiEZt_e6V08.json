 "description": "In this episode I am joined again by the poet-priest-scholar Malcolm Guite for a wonderful wide discussion about imagination, Christianity, the relative success of Britain's blending of Christian and pagan stories in contrast with the 'missed opportunity' (so far) in the Americas, and finally, the intoxicating world of King Arthur.\n\nContents\n00:29 \u2013 Introduction\n02:53 \u2013 Malcolm's new book \u201cLifting the Veil \u2013 Imagination and the Kingdom of God\"\n03:41 \u2013 The imagination as \u201ca truth-bearing faculty\u201d\n18:56 \u2013 Pondering the 'emergence/emanation' framework of Vervaeke, VanderKlay, Pageau, and...Shakespeare?\n25:10 \u2013 Christ and the artistic, moral, and prophetic imagination\n38:04 \u2013 The reassuringly honest depiction of bewilderment of the disciples in the gospels\n43:24 \u2013 'Credo ut intellegam: I believe in order to understand'\n50:19 \u2013 A brief intermission to pour scotch\n51:23 \u2013 Contrasting the appealing fusion of the Christian and pagan in Britain with a missed opportunity in the Americas\n1:14:34 \u2013 Malcolm shares his love of the King Arthur stories, the legend which can't be hacked down\n1:27:01 \u2013 How does a poet continue the tradition of adding to the Arthurian storytelling today?\n\nMalcolm's new book:\nhttps://www.squarehalobooks.com/lifting-the-veil\n\nHis blog:\nhttps://malcolmguite.wordpress.com/blog/\n\nHis Youtube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXat06LvIYIyE2SpV_IuVjA\n\nMore links to poems and other things mentioned in this conversation here on TheCommonToad site:\nhttps://www.thecommontoad.com/single-post/conversations-malcolm-guite-lifting-the-veil-and-keeping-the-flowering-thorn",
