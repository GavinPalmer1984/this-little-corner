 "description": "Martin Shaw is, among many things, a writer, mythologist, teacher, and rite-of-passage guide. He's director of the Westcountry School of Myth in the UK, originated and led the Oral Tradition course at Stanford University. Perhaps most crucially, he lived for four years in a tent. It was a great pleasure to discuss with him storytelling, pagan and Christian tales, the Irish figure John Moriarty, and quite a bit more. \n\nContents:\n00:29 \u2013 Introduction\n01:50 \u2013 The Storyteller: \u201cTake your imagination for a walk in public\u201d \n13:28 \u2013 Old stories and contemporary minds \n17:03 \u2013 Martin's geographic area of interest\n19:03 \u2013 \u201cThe eagle attracts the hunter\u201d - Martin goes to the woods and is astonished by Christianity \n24:05 \u2013 Is there a wall between the Christian and 'pagan' worlds, and is it permeable?\n34:08 \u2013 Reconciling pagan and Christian sensibilities, and facing objections from either end\n38:18 \u2013 Is the Orthodox church in Alaska a back door to a better communion between mainstream and native cultures on the American continent?\n42:24 \u2013 The catastrophe of fear-based religion\n46:11 \u2013 Who was John Moriarty?\n51:09 \u2013 The Chant\n56:51 \u2013 No Christmas for the animals: Moriarty's search for locating meaning\n1:02:38 \u2013 Moriarty's Joycean walk home from the pub, and reenchanting our daily lives\n1:08:06 \u2013 On goodness\n1:14:25 \u2013 On this moment\n1:17:51 \u2013 New steps and projects for Martin\n\n\nhttps://martinshaw.substack.com/\n\nFor",
