 "description": "In honor of the fourth anniversary of the liberation of Mosul from ISIS, I'm posting a clip of my discussion with the extraordinary Omar Mohammed, creator of Mosul Eye. Here he discusses the aliases or \"characters\" he assumed while gathering information in the ISIS-occupied streets of Mosul, the burden which drove him to wish for death, and his eventual loss of fear and \"rebirth\" as a stronger person.\n\nhttps://mosul-eye.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/MosulEye",
