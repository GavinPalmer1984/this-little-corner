 "description": "Paul VanderKlay is a pastor in California and a member of the Christian Reformed Church. He has a Youtube channel where one can find a rich and prodigious collection of conversations and monologues on Christianity, philosophy, human psychology, and social commentary.\n\nWe talked about his experiences as a third generation pastor, the state of dialogue between Christians, atheists, and agnostics, as well as the nature of belief, the Logos, and the culture wars. \n\nIt was a great pleasure to talk to him.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n04:19 - A third-generation pastor recalls his beginnings and contends with modern challenges\n14:51 - Why Paul spends so much time talking to non-believers, and likes it!\n18:57 - New Atheism as the first crude throat-clearings of a better conversation between atheists and believers\n32:12 - Language, Imagination, and Logos\n42:02 - Pastoring in the midst of human suffering - when theology comes down to Earth\n52:08 - OK, the Gospels are good. Are they effective?\n1:00:53 - TheCommonToad takes a moment to doubt the Intellectual Dark Web is free of ideology\n1:02:29 - Historian Tom Holland's refreshingly nuanced take on the double-edged sword of Wokeness\n1:19:28 - What keeps faith turned on? Paul gives a moving testimony.\n\nhttps://www.thecommontoad.com/single-post/conversations-paul-vanderklay-good-faith\n\nPaul's Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/paulvanderklay",
