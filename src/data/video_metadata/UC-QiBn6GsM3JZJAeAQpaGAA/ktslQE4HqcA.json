 "description": "Wonders are folded \ninto every corner of the earth \nIn a forest path this morning in the sun \nI saw the hand of the wind \nclean the trees of last night's rain \nand then disappear \n\nThe shadowed meadows turned merry a moment  \nand then cold again in gloom \nAnd the jays shot beautifully  \nacross the woods and yelled  \nconceits to no good end \n\nAnd I sit under blue heaven \nwith its big white ships \ndrifting as one to happier battles beyond my sight \n\nI have always been too small for this \nMy head hurts a little \n\nI can only hold my breath a minute and \nexpel it awkwardly  \ncoughing in a field of embarrassed sunflowers\n\nI can barely sit and bow my head \nbefore a bad song trips through it in circles \n\nBut the Love of the world continuously passes over  \neverything amid its mysterious business \nThe wind is its train \nand the trees and I and the birds \nare ever in thrall \n\nAnd the Love of the world passes and then all is quiet \n\nAnd what has been blown awake? \nWhat eye in me  \nopens for a moment against its spell, \nlongs for home,  \nand returns to sleep?",
