 "description": "Updated version.  The original was posted here (https://youtu.be/2hIXXbznbaM), but the opening 3-4 minutes of Sam and Bill's convo was inadvertently cut.\n\nGinger Bill and Sam Adams discuss Sir Roger Penrose and William Lane Craig's appearance on Unbelievable. How does consciousness relate to the material world? How do our minds understand eternal truths? Why is physics written in math? What does God have to do with it? Sam and Bill give us definitive answers to these questions so we can finally move on.",
