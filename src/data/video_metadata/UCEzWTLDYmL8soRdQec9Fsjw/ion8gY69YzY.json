They will know that now first are they fully themselves. The avaricious, weary, selfish, suspicious old man shall have passed away. The young, ever young self, will remain. That which they thought themselves shall have vanished: that which they felt themselves, though they misjudged their own feelings, shall remain\u2014remain glorified in repentant hope. For that which cannot be shaken shall remain. That which is immortal in God shall remain in man.
