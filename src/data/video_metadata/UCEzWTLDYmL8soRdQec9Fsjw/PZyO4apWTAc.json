 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZyO4apWTAc",
 "date": "2022-01-24",
 "description": "Kal chats with Josiah Gorter, a young Reformed pastor, about Calvinism and Reformed theology broadly. Although Kal probes and critique some Calvinist doctrines, he also tries to highlight the motivations--biblical and theological--behind them in order to give Calvinism a more balanced treatment than it usually gets from him. He let's Josiah lay out his views at some length and distinguish his personal hunches and predilections from what you might call \"orthodox\" Reformed theology, for which he does not claim to be a spokesperson (although his credentials seem strong to Kal). Hopefully there will be more conversations like this to follow.",
