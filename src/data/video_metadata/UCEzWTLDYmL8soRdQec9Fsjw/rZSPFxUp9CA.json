 "description": "Paul, Jon, and Sam discuss the role of prophecy and prophets in the churches that they grew up in. They discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly of charismaticism and what the larger Christian world can learn from it. They also discuss what the charismatic world can learn from the larger Christian world in return. Finally, they bring in the work of John Vervaeke and the benefit he brings for helping Christians make sense of their own experience.\n\nPaul Antleitner's podcast: https://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com/\nSam Adam's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg7Ed0lecvko58ibuX1XHng",
