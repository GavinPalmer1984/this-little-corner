This is chapter one of the first book in the series called \"Out of the Silent Planet.\"  After that Luke shares his thoughts, and we walk through them, as well as bits and pieces of the chapter together.\n\nThe book we're retelling:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Silent-Planet-Space-Trilogy-Paperback/dp/0743234901", "duration": 4184, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "alright Luke we're recording how
