 "description": "Mary tells Luke about her journey from her life with the Jehovah's Witnesses into Catholicism through Protestantism.  Luke shares parts of his journey from Protestantism and an intellectually centered faith towards Eastern Orthodoxy.  Along the way, they find the intersecting points of Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy and open a discussion on the Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine in Christianity that ends up being too big to cover in one video.  Check out what's sure to be part one of a continued conversation.\n\nJoin the ConverZation.  Talk to PVK Randos and their ilk here:\nhttps://discord.gg/zdjzsFu\n\nCheck out Paul Vanderklay's channel here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsD...\n\nThe debate on Hell that Luke references:\nhttps://youtu.be/W-KARdhmdSw",
