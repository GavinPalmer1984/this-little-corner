 "description": "Ben and Tyler consider the psychological phenomena that surround sports from the perspective of athletes, individual spectators, and communities.  Can sportsmanship transcend tribalism, corporatism, celebrity culture, and the hunger for success?  What do war and sports have in common?  How about politics and sports?  Is the spirit of geometry best suited for sports and politics, or the spirit of finesse?  Both? Ben and Tyler talk about all this and so much more.\n\nJoin the ConverZation here:\nhttps://discord.gg/j8ps92H",
