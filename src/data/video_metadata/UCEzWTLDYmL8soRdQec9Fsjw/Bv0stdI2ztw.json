Jeff gets in an obligatory CS Lewis quote, Paul resists Luke and Jeff's temptations to violate his CRC orders, and Job waves at adoring fans then talks about how to navigate the inevitability of stepping on folk's toes when doing the dance of our various daily and weekly liturgies with people.\n\nAll this and more is 'tightly' packed in this video that comes in at slightly under 2 hours.\n\nIf you want to interact with internet randos like these in discussions like this, join them on the Bridges of Meaning Discord server: https://discord.gg/vs7gES\n\nEllis Porter's 3 (actually
