 "description": "Jeff P, Jess P, & Luke T discuss the problem with God asking Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.  Prompted by a previous Randos discussion between Nathan and Julian, titled \"Honest Objections\".   Nathan asked some simple and difficult questions.  Does a religion where God asks a man to sacrifice his son set a bad precedent?  Could God ask you to kill your mother?\n\nGod doesn't just ask Abraham to kill his son, but he also interrupts him as he raises the knife and provides a substitute.",
