 "title": "Rivers o Feden on the Prologue of John (Introduction and Summary)",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azSNgWEv6R0",
 "date": "2021-01-12",
 "description": "Rivers o Feden is a self taught bible student who is very good at Greek. He has a very interesting interpretation of the prologue of gospel of John. In this conversation we do a high level overview of his interpretation of the prologue and how that fits into the larger picture of the gospel. Rivers' interpretation is compatible with a Biblical Unitarian understanding of Jesus but it is different than the way most Unitarians have interpreted the prologue in recent times. If you enjoy this episode and want to dig in deeper Rivers and I recorded over 3 hours of content and I will be posting the full video at a later date.",
