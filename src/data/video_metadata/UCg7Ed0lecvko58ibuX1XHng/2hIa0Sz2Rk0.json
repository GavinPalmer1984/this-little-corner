He has developed a model of social trinitarianism complimented by a deeper understanding of group personhood. I feel like his model is one of the best and most compelling articulations of social trinitarianism that many people could learn from.  He also challenges me with arguments against Biblical Unitarianism. We mention Dale Tuggy, William Lane Craig, Augustine, Larry Hurtado, Bishop Barron, Cosmic Skeptic, Gregory of Nazianzus, Thomas Aquinas, Richard Bauckham, Richard Swinburn, and more.\n\n00:00:00 -
