 "description": "Here is the introduction video that should be watched first: https://youtu.be/azSNgWEv6R0\n\nRivers o Feden is a self taught bible student who is very good at Greek. He has a very interesting interpretation of the prologue of gospel of John. In this conversation we do a in depth examination of his interpretation of the prologue and how that fits into the larger picture of the gospel. Rivers' interpretation is compatible with a Biblical Unitarian understanding of Jesus but it is different than the way most Unitarians have interpreted the prologue in recent times. In this episode I dig deeper with Rivers and we go through the prologue verse by verse.\n\n0:00:00 - Introduction\n0:01:30 - v01 - \"In the beginning\"\n0:06:45 - v01 - \"Logos\"\n0:17:55 - v01 - \"Was with God\"\n0:30:00 - v01 - \"God\"\n0:31:10 - v01 - \"Word was God\"\n0:43:00 - v02 - \"Houtos\"\n0:52:15 - v03 - \"All things\"\n0:54:55 - v03 - \"Egeneto\"\n1:01:50 - v03 - \"Without him was not any thing\"\n1:07:15 - v04 - \"Life\"\n1:10:00 - v04 - \"Autou\"\n1:12:00 - v04 - \"Life\"\n1:14:25 - v05 - \"Light shines in the darkness\"\n1:18:45 - v05 - \"Darkness did not comprehend\"\n1:23:00 - v06 - \"Sent from God\"\n1:23:50 - v06 - \"Whose name was John\"\n1:24:20 - v07 - \"He came as a witness\"\n1:28:00 - v09 - \"True light\"\n1:29:45 - v10 - \"Cosmos\"\n1:39:49 - v13 - \"Born\"\n1:50:00 - v14 - \"Word became flesh\"\n1:59:25 - v14 - \"Glory\"\n2:08:40 - v14 - \"Monogenes\"\n2:11:40 - v14 - \"Full of grace and truth\"\n2:13:55 - v15 - \"He was before me\"\n2:24:50 - v17 - \"The law was given through Moses\"\n2:29:50 - v18 - \"Only begotten god\"\n2:35:00 - v18 - \"No one has seen god\"\n2:40:40 - v18 - \"He has made him known\"\n2:43:10 - v18 - \"Is in the bosom of the Father\"\n2:46:00 - v08 - \"Recapping thoughts on autou\"\n2:49:00 - Closing remarks",
