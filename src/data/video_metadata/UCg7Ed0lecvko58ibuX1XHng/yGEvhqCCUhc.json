This episode is about Irenaeus of Lyon. He was the Bishop of Lyon in southern France but he had grown up in Smyrna. We discuss his biography, his importance in church history, his writings, his views on gnosticism, his Christology, and other facets of his theology. We also draw parallels and applications of his life and message for Christians today. We also mention Paul Vanderklay, John Behr, Jonathan Pageau, John Vervaeke, Jordan Peterson, Bishop Barron, James Lindsay, Polycarp, Valentinus, Ignatius of Antioch, John Calvin, Martin Luther, and many more. I hope you enjoy and learn from our discussion. \n\nAnchor Podcasts: https://anchor.fm/transfigured-sam\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/30q4W2esWfIwiUQMcABD4y\nApple:
