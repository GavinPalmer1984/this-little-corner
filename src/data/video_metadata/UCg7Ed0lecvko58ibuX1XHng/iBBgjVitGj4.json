 "title": "Dr. Khalil Andani on Ismaili Muslim and Biblical Unitarian views of Jesus",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBBgjVitGj4",
 "date": "2020-04-15",
 "description": "Dr. Khalil Andani is an Assistant Professor of Religion at Augustana College and a recent PhD graduate from Harvard University. Dr. Andani is a member of the Nizari branch of Ismaili Shi'i Islam. He invited me to have a dialogue with him about my views on Jesus as a Biblical Unitarian Christian for his class \"Global Christians: Christian-Muslim Encounters\". As far as either of us are aware our particular traditions have never had such a dialogue publicly before and we find a lot we can agree on and understand about each other.\n\nThe central topic is who is Jesus? What is Jesus's connection to God? Can Jesus be worshiped? How do we talk about our worship or veneration of Jesus? \n\nSome people mentioned are Photinus of Ancyra, Plotinus, Arius, Athanasius of Alexandria, Thomas Aquinas, Averroes, Avicenna, Aga Khan, Alvin Platinga, Kegan Chandler, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Augustine, and many others. Hope you enjoy.",
