Dale defends what might be called the \"Genesis Beginnings\" interpretation or what I call \"Personified Logos with a soft incarnation\" interpretation. Bill argues for the \"New Beginnings\" view. \n\nDale Tuggy is an Analytic Philosopher of Religion. He hosts the \"Trinities\" Podcast. He has a lot of great content on the Philosophy and History of christology and other theological topics.  \nYoutube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/khanpadawan\nBlog: https://trinities.org/blog/\n\nBill Schlegel is a Professor in Exile. Formerly of Masters University Bill was unceremoniously removed from his long-time position after changing his mind on the trinity. Bill is also the host of the \"One God Report\", a podcast delving deep into biblical passages about christology.\nSee his and his wife's amazing testimony video here.
