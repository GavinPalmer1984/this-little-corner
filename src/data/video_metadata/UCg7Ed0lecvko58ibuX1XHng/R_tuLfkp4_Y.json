Much of his research has focused on the theology of the Trinity and the Eastern Greek Church Fathers. He has engaged with Dr. Dale Tuggy to demonstrate how a proper understanding of the Patristic doctrine of the Monarchy of the Father can solve many of the philosophical problems found in other trinity theories. The conversation ranges from Christian History, Jewish mysticism, Neoplatonism, the connection between philosophy and theology, biblical exegesis, stoeriology, and the strengths and weaknesses of Biblical Unitarianism. Dr. Branson was very generous with his time to have this conversation with me. We both share the goal of helping Christians with different perspectives engage with each other to foster meaningful conversation. He shares very interesting details of his personal story and how this is related to his current philosophical perspective.", "duration": 8994, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "three hello this is Sam I'm here with", "start": 0.0, "duration": 7.919}, {"text": "dr.
