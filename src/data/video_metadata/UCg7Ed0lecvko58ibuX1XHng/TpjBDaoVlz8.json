 "description": "Luke returns for a second conversation. This time Sam and Luke discuss Philippians 2, The Christ Hymn. Sam presents a Biblical Unitarian interpretation of the passage and Luke gives his feedback from an Eastern Orthodox Monarchical Trinitarian perspective. This video in both in response to the debate between Dale Tuggy and Christ Date and in anticipation of an upcoming debate/discussion between Sam and Chris Date. Because this is Sam and Luke they don't always stay on topic and mention Dr. Preston Sprinkle, Paul Vanderklay, Owen Barfield, Julian the Apostate, Lewis Carrol, Guy Sengstock, Jordan Peterson, Arius of Alexandria, David Bentley Hart, and Larry Hurtado.\n\nMy previous conversation with Dr. Beau Branson was mentioned multiple times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_tuLfkp4_Y&t=2235s\n\nDale Tuggy and Chris Date Debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35_uFjEbx8",
