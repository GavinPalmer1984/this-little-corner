You can see her tell her story with Paul Vanderklay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYDJjVbG3mk\n\nWe talk about a journey into the church fathers and seeing theology through their lenses. We talk about Origen of Alexandria, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus the Confessor. We also talk about modern day influences like Jordan Peterson, Paul Vanderklay, Herbert McCabe, Fr John Behr, David Bentley Hart, Beau Branson, Bret Salkheld, George McDonald, CS Lewis, and JRR Tolkein. Hope you enjoy.",
