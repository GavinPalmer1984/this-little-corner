We don't know much about Athenagoras but we have 1 maybe 2 of his letters. His most important work is \"A Plea for the Christians\" written around 165AD to the emperor Marcus Aurelius for the purpose of convincing the Emperor to end the persecution of Christians. Athenagoras was a well trained philosopher and was probably the smartest and more articulate of the church fathers of the second century and we hope to bring more attention to his importance with this episode.\n\nA Plea for the Christians: https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm\n\nLink to podcast:
