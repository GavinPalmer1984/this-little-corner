 "description": "John Vervaeke is a Professor of Cognitive Science and Psychology at the University of Toronto. He has an excellent youtube channel and I would particularly recommend his series \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\".\n\nMy first conversation with Vervaeke: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ZpIN85gBQ\n\nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_...\n\nJohn Vervaeke, Paul Vanderklay, JP Marceau on Teleology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXgDelZcebo&t=95s\n\nThe main topic of this conversation is whether the whole of existence has a purpose, or whether purpose is only realized at local levels. We mention Plato, Paul Vanderklay, JP Marceau, Pope Francis, Paul Anleitner, Spinoza, the fine tuning argument, Aristotle.\n\nLink to the podcast version of this video: https://anchor.fm/transfigured-sam/episodes/John-Vervaeke-on-Purpose--Non-theism--and-Christianity-e1alhl2\n\n\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:02:30 - Christianity and the 4-Ps\n00:34:00 - How high does purpose go?\n00:45:45 - The basics of purpose\n01:14:00 - Fine Tuning the Arena\n01:19:00 - The pull of the kingdom of heaven\n01:31:00 - Closing Thoughts",
