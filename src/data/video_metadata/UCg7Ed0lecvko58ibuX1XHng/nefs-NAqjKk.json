 "description": "Charlie has his own channel called Thought Journey that you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-Hga0OoEHlzSJgRNmr7Aw\n\nCharlie was raised Southern Baptist with a brief stint in Oneness Pentecostalism. He has an MDiv from Dallas Theological Seminary. He preaches at his church in Arkansas. We try and see if we can agree on who Jesus is and how he relates to God. It sounds like we get pretty close. We specifically look at Matthew 24 and Revelation 4&5 as part of our conversation. We mention Paul Vanderklay and Luke Thompson and Jacob Faturechi whose channel you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/user/faturechi/videos",
