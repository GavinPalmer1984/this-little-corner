 "description": "Dr. Dustin Smith is the host of the Biblical Unitarian Podcast. He is also an expert on the Book of Revelation also known as the Apocalypse of John. While most of the time people associate Revelation with eschatology, in this video we focus on what we can learn about Christology. We mostly set eschatology aside and cover Dustin's own personal story, his interest in the book, the background of the book, and then what we can learn about God, Jesus, and even the Holy Spirit. I really enjoyed talking with Dustin and I hope you will enjoy it too.\n\nYou can find \"The Biblical Unitarian\" podcast where ever you get your podcasts but here is a link:https://biblicalunitarianpodcast.podbean.com/\n\nDustin has also appeared on youtube before and here is a selection of some of my favorite videos of his.\nJewish Preexistence in John: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZE4Ihjv0Wc\nPhilippians 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCl-MSumQM",
