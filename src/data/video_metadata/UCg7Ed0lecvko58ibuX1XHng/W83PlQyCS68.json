 "description": "This is a casual 4-way conversation between friends. None of us are professional theologians but we are all very interested in the topics of Unitarians vs Trinitarianism and Universalism vs Annihilationism vs Eternal Conscious Torment. \n\nJeff has a background in various forms of conservative evangelicalism growing up in Texas. He also is a CS Lewis and George McDonald quote encyclopedia. You can learn more about his story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAHv6_LG_w\n\nLuke has been on the channel before. He grew up in the young, restless, and reformed circles but is now on the path to Eastern Orthodoxy. You can learn more about his story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSiCZLHkZXA\n\nCharlie is from Arkansas and grew up Southern Baptist being really involved with his church. He had a period of atheism and is now getting back into religion. He has his one youtube channel which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-Hga0OoEHlzSJgRNmr7Aw",
