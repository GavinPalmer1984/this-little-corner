He is a priest in the Church of England. He is a leading Christian Philosopher supporting an idealist view of reality. He has written many books but we focus our discussion on his book \"Christ and the Cosmos: A reformulation of trinitarian doctrine.\n\nWe talk about his understanding of the doctrine of the trinity and how this is similar to and different from versions of the trinity based on doctrines of divine simplicity and social doctrines of the trinity. We mention A.J. Ayer, Karl Rahner, Karl Barth, Thomas Aquinas, Plato, Aristotle, Neoplatonism, Richard Swinburne, Beau Branson, and Daniel Dennett. \n\nYou can find Keith Ward's book here:
