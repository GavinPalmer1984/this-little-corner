He has a background in philosophy with interests in the patristic period of the church fathers, neoplatonism, and Thomism. He combines these old ideas with new philosophical schools of thought like panpsychism and process theology. \n\nWe have an interesting discussion covering many people like John Vervaeke, Jonathan Pageau, Mary Kochan, Bertrand Russell, Henry Bergson, Thomas Aquinas, St Maximus the Confessor, John Scotus Eriugena, Plotinus, Beau Branson, Augustine, Khalil Andani, the Cappacodcian Fathers, Irenaeus of Lyon, Godel's incompleteness theorem, and much more.\n\nHere is JP's youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzlvx0HHYiPOJTEOU399WA\n\nHere is JP's talk with Paul Vanderklay:
