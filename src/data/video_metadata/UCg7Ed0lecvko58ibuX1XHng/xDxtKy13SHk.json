 "description": "Julian is a friend I met in the community around Paul VanderKlay. He is a Hutterite from Canada who has recently taken upon himself to learn more about the Trinity. We discuss the connection between belief and practice, trinitarian education, the historical connections between Hutterites and Unitarians, primitivism, Schleiermacher, Fred Sanders, Michael Reeves, Karl Barth, Jordan Peterson, evangelical identity, cardinal sins, Michael Polanyi, tacit belief, the difficulties of interpretation, Bart Ehrman, proper Christian cultural engagement, Neoplatonism, Alister McGrath, the Bible Project, and just who is this Jesus? The conversation ends abruptly due to connectivity issues, but we hope to resume it again soon.",
