She has written a book titled \"The Mirror and the Mask: Liberating the Gospels from Literary Devices\". We talk about the difference between a literary device model supported by Dr. Michael Licona and the historical reportage model supported by Dr. McGrew. As a statistician I enjoyed getting to talk with Dr. McGrew about probability theory and how we can apply that to our understanding of the gospels. We discuss implications for these different understandings of the gospels for apologetics, for faith, and for understanding Christology. We also spend a good amount of time discussing the christology in the gospel of John. This was a very fun discussion and I hope you will enjoy!\n\nDr. Lydia McGrew's books.\nThe Mirror and the Mask: https://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Mask-Liberating-Gospels-Literary/dp/1947929070\nHidden in
