This conversation was spurred on by the recent conversation between Paul Vanderklay, John Vervaeke and JP regarding miracles and the logos. JP and I talk about that topic other how we can understand immanence, emergence, the logos together with a focus on Christ. We mention Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, Keiji Nishitani, Plotinus, Bishop Barron, Jordan Peterson, CS Lewis, John Scotus Eriugena and more. \n\nYou will benefit most from watching this recent conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGoil4zuQPc&t=84s\n\nThis is the first conversation between Vervaeke, Vanderklay, and Marceau: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCeHJtdQ0fg&t=0s\n\nCheck
