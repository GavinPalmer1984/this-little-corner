 "description": "Brett Salkeld is a Catholic Theologian and author of a new book on Transubstantiation.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Transubstantiation-Theology-History-Christian-Unity/dp/1540960552\n\nHe explores the often misunderstood Thomistic doctrine of transubstantiation and how that relates to the eucharistic theologies of Martin Luther and John Calvin. His bold proposals suggest that a better understanding of Thomas Aquinas can actually help lead to greater unity between Catholics and Protestants, and even within Protestants, on this often contentious issue. We all talk about the sacramental nature of reality, Paul Vanderklay, Jonathan Pageau, Athanasius, the history of Unitarianism, adoptionism, and much more.",
