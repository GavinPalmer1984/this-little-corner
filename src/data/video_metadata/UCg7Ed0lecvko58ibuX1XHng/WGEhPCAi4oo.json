 "description": "This conversation continues our series of dialogues with Sam and Hank on the church fathers. This episode we talk about Tertullian of Carthage. We cover Tertullian's background, the history and relevance of the montanist movement, and Tertullian's views on trinitarian theology. We will likely have at least one more episode covering other areas of Tertullian's theology. Hope you enjoy. We mention James White, Paul Vanderklay, Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism, Esther O'Reilly,  The emperor Justinian, Beth Moore, Luke Thompson, Kierkegaard, John Walton, Dale Tuggy, Beau Branson, Joshua Sijuwade, and many more. \n\nProphets and Gravestones by William Tabbernee: https://www.amazon.com/Prophets-Gravestones-Imaginative-Montanists-Christians/dp/0801047811\n\n00:00:00 - Tertullian's Background\n00:10:45 - Montanism and the New Prophecy\n00:37:20 - Tertullian on the Trinity\n01:33:00 - Closing remarks on Tertullian's relevance",
