 "description": "In 1861, French intellectual giant Victor Hugo released his book Les Mis\u00e9rables. I have lately started reading it. It is divided into five major parts; I discuss \"Fantine,\" the first of these parts, in this video. This video is basically my notes on Fantine. This is mostly to help me sort out my thoughts on it and I hope it may be helpful to others as well. \n\nThis is episode 23 of my podcast. \n\nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining Ideas | The Colton Kirby Show: https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\n--Links--\nMy Website: https://www.coltonkirby.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nParler: https://parler.com/profile/coltonkirby/posts\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_coltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/\nQuora: https://www.quora.com/profile/Colton-Kirby-7",
