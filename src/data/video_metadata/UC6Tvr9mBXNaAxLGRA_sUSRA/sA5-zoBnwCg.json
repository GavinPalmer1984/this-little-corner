 "description": "This is my first conversation with Richard. I had some technical difficulties during this conversation, and, because of this, the beginning was not recorded. We prayed to begin the conversation which Richard thought would be a good \"angel\" (or \"spirit\") to start our conversation out with (and I agreed). We talked about our own lives and then transitioned to briefly talk about the nature of truth (which we hope to continue discussing in the future). I hope someone finds something helpful in here. I greatly enjoyed it and look forward to the next time I will get to talk to Richard. \n\nRichard's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNUT7IEBjQHGmpdq5PxALUQ\n\nNote: for those of you who were regularly watching my videos I apologize for the complete halt in production over the last month. I am, at the moment, planning to try to release one video every Tuesday. I think the size of my channel doesn't warrant any more than that and I am also having many things to tend to outside of my stuff online. Hopefully I can keep the once-a-week pace up. \n\nThis conversation was recorded on February 13th, 2022. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby",
