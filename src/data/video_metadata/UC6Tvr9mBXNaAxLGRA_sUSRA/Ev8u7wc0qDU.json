 "description": "This video is a little messy and some parts are better than others. I was trying to get to what each Travis and Joel were actually saying and why they weren't fully able to talk to one another. Also, I comment on Travis's vision for morality. I won't be doing commentary on the last part since it is largely more of the same. \n\nThis is episode 60 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby",
