 "description": "I received a very meaty comment from my Odysseus video. I thought I would use it as a springboard for this video. I try to piece out the differences between taking vengeance and forgiveness, discipline versus mercy, and God dealing with injustice. There's a ton of thinking out loud and wandering in this video.\n\nThanks to Pam for letting me use this comment of hers. Hopefully I didn't disabuse it too much. \n\nThis was recorded on April 27th, 2022.\n\nThis is episode 82 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialcoltonkirby\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129883782-colton-kirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/_saved/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby\nBooks Wish List: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GTqvKmd3Ter2WCpBwU2DkuD-Qse6xiLAqJFGZzWToo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you want to financially support what I\u2019m doing, you can give one-off donations here (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/ColtonKirby",
