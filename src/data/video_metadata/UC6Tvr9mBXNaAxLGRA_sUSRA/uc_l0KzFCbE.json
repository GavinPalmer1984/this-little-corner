In this one, I try to really get down to the differences between Love and Hate. There are a lot of other ways you could frame it: longsuffering versus anger, forgiveness versus revenge, etc. This is the fundamental divide in the Iliad, and, perhaps, in existence itself (not to sound too dogmatic). \n\n1st Iliad video: https://youtu.be/ZjYv-VYzeA4\n2nd Iliad video: https://youtu.be/PppUe2XvZpY\n\nThis is episode 55 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing:
