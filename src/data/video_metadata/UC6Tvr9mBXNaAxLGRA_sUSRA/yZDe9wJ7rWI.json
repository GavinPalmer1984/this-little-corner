 "description": "In this video, I talk about Sophocles\u2019s play Oedipus Rex. I find that there is a lot to mine here. The main themes I got from it this time: how Oedipus crosses and blurs fundamental boundaries, how to deal with the fates\u2019 (or suffering\u2019s) power in the world, and how commitment is necessary for any proper integration to happen. I hope you all find something meaningful here. \n\nThis was recorded on May 22, 2022.\n\nThis is episode 83 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialcoltonkirby\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129883782-colton-kirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/_saved/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby\nBooks Wish List: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GTqvKmd3Ter2WCpBwU2DkuD-Qse6xiLAqJFGZzWToo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you want to financially support what I\u2019m doing, you can give one-off donations here (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/ColtonKirby",
