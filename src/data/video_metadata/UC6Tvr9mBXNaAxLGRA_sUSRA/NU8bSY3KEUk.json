 "description": "Michelangelo's Pieta is an amazing work of art. Aside from the sheer artistic quality of the work, the Pieta is a symbol of the existence of sacrifice, suffering, and meaning; it is the Gospel of Christ and the relationship of God to man, the beacon of God's love. We look at all these things and more in this episode. \n\nThis is episode 10 of my podcast. \n\nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining Ideas | The Colton Kirby Show: https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\n--Links--\nMy Website: https://www.coltonkirby.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nParler: https://parler.com/profile/coltonkirby/posts\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_coltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/\nQuora: https://www.quora.com/profile/Colton-Kirby-7",
