In this video, I look at an article put out by the Church's website and take it apart.\n\nThe article: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god?lang=eng&fbclid=IwAR3iM6jjsy8G65t3u2dMS_QH6fXrBPojm_jjLyOX8kLbbfe0db4jyrBacC4\n\nThis is episode
