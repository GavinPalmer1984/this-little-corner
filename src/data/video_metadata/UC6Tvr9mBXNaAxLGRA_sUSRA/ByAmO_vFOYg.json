 "description": "I thought I would use this video to help me think through the introduction I have to my Senior Thesis. I have since done another draft of my introduction that I feel is improved, partly through the help of this video. In the video, I talk about the modern phenomena of dating apps and hookup culture and how that intersects with real life. In short, the former doesn't translate to the latter very well. I hope this was interesting to someone. Let me know what you all think if you get a chance. \n\nThis was recorded on March 13th, 2022.\n\nThis is episode 73 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129883782-colton-kirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby\nBooks Wish List: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GTqvKmd3Ter2WCpBwU2DkuD-Qse6xiLAqJFGZzWToo/edit",
