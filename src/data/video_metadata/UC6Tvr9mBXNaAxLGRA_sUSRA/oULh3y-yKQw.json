Working off the back of Atheism and the \"death of God,\" Rand created a philosophy to live in the world. With the virtue of selfishness, she believed that the world would be a better place. However, Rand's literature is cheap, her ideas are generic, and her philosophy falls apart under pressure. In this video, we look at why this is the case and also some of the good things about Rand. \n\nThis is episode 9 of my podcast. \n\nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining
