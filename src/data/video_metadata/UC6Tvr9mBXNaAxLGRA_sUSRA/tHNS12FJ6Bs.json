It's been almost a whole year since I have deeply engaged with these topics, so I am quite rusty (as can be seen from the video). David and I go through the five points on Calvinism and what a Classical Arminian perspective of them is. David also takes the time to respond and give his take on several \"Calvinistic\" passages. \n\nSince this was our first lengthy interaction with each other in engaging these topics, it seemed to me that there was some feeling out of the other's position (or, at least, that was the case for me). The real rub of the issue seems to be: Do we do any actions in order to be saved; and what do we mean by actions? Both David's Classical Arminianism and a traditional Calvinistic perspective say we do no \"works\" to be saved. \n\nI personally feel that this is a harder sell for the Arminian, although it is easier to keep free will with such a position. With any luck, David and I will be able to have another conversation where David tries to lay out why an Arminianism truly is not saying that free will in salvation involves \"works\" on the part of humanity.\n\nHere is David's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8sTncrKOJtT3J4TEwg7fag\n\nThis is episode 28 of my podcast. \n\nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining
