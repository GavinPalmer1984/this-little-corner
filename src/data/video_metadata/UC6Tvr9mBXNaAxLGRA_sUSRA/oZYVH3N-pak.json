 "description": "Notes from \"Cosette\" in Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables\n\nThis is episode 33 of my podcast. \n\nThis is the second part of Les Miserables. Aside from other things, I talk about truth, types of worlds, the nature of justice, the nature of being, the ways in which evil and good connect, and more. This book is fascinating. I'm trying to sort out a lot of things here and am thinking out loud.
