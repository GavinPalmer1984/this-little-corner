 "description": "This speech was given April 23, 2021\n\nIt is part memorized and part extemporaneous (although I was hoping to have it all memorized, which did not happen). \n\nIn this speech, I argue that there be term limits set on Congress. This speech was called \u201cOriginal Advocacy Speech\u201d where we were to advocate for a particulate price of legislation. \n\n\nHere is my original script for the speech. As I said, I did not record this fully as I had intended to; but ti was close enough:\n\nIntroduction\n-Many people are now serving as life long politicans; a process which the Founders did not intent for the U.S. This has and will cause must strife undue to stagnation. The vast majority of people are not pleased by Congress. By passing an Article which sets term limits on Congress, we will be returning back to what the original intent of that body was, and also be more closely following the model of Representative government. \n\nThe Presentation of the Problem: \n-From 1964-2018, the reelectin rate in the House has never fallen below 80%\n-From 1964-2018, the reelection rate in the Senate has only been below 80% 9 times\n-Ronald Rotunda, Chapman University law professor and constitutional expert said: \u201cturnover in the House of Lords has been greater than turnover in the House of Representatives. There was even more turnover in the Soviet Politburo.\u201d\n-During the Constitutional Convention on June 2, Benjamin Franklin argued for a de facto term limit in governmental service. \n-Not until 1901 did the average number of terms served rise above 2 in congress\n-In a reply letter to James Madison in 1787 about the proposed Constitution, Thomas Jefferson remarked: \u201cI dislike and strongly dislike . . . the abandonment in every instance of the principle of rotation in office . . .\u201d \n-In Febuary 1800, Jefferson remarked to Samuel Adams: \u201cgovernment by representatives, elected by the people at short periods, was our object, and our maxim at that day was, \u2018Where annual election ends, tyranny begins . . .\u201d \n-The Founders did not intend life-long political careers\n-Congressional approval ratings have not gone above 30% since when such statistics started to be collected: in 2009\n\nWhat Actions must be taken to Address the Problem: \n-An amendment will be declared: \n-SECTION 1: No Person may serve more than twelve years as a member of congress; such service includes individually the House and Senate combined in both Houses.\n-SECTION 2: Upon ratification of this Article, any incumbent member of Congress whose term exceeds the twelve-year limit shall complete their current term, but will thereafter be inelgible of for further service as a member of Congress. \n\nIllustrating the Effectiveness of the Plan: \n-This plan will put a stop to the career long politician.\n-It will restore power back to those who represent their respective districts more accurately.\n-It will manifest the original intent of the Founders for the Congress and its terms\n-It will prevent the Congress from growing increasingly authoritarian\n\nConclusion:\n-The vision for the country was not one of lifelong rulers and politicians. Americans have let the arrogant \u201celites\u201d get away with abusive power for far too long.  This act will not solve all our problems, but it ramifications will be great. America was founded as a place where the people should have the final say, not the government. However, it is often nowadays the other way around. By prohibitng those in Congress from serving for perpetuity, we will be one more step, albeit a small step, but a step nonetheless towards restoring power to the people.",
