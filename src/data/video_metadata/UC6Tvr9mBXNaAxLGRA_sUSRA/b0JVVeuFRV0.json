I only got through 4 of the total 15 I wanted to respond to. I will get to the others in more videos. Here is the link to the list I am responding to: https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/biblical-contradictions/\n\nI hope this may be helpful to someone. I tried to avoid apologizing for these passages or explaining them away. I felt that the article which listed these contradictions was rather disingenuous. If one feels that I improperly addressed these passages, then I would be happy to try to adjust my understanding if reason warrants that.  \n\n*THE THUMBNAIL IMAGE OF THIS VIDEO BELONGS TO THE AMERICAN ATHEISTS ASSOCIATION. IN NO WAY AM I TRYING TO MISREPRESENT THEM WITH THE USE OF THIS IMAGE. \n\nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining Ideas | The Colton Kirby Show:
