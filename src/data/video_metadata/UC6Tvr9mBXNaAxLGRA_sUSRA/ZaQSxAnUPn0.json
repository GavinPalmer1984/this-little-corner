This book was, by all means, earth-shaking. I usually do not plan to devote entire podcast episodes to a single book, but this one deserves it. In this episode, I talk about the book, some of the concepts therein, and the ramifications that it would have if we took Medievalism seriously. \n\nBuy this book now:
