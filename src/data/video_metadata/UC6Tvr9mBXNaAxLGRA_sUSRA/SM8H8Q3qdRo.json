 "description": "In this video, I talk with Noah Shaffmaster, my friend from the basketball team. This was my first in-person conversation that I\u2019ve recorded and posted. In it, we go and talk about everything from cults to Christianity. Noah and I have had a few deep in-person conversations, so this one more or less builds off of some of those. I\u2019ve been trying to understand what Noah thinks about God and religion and this conversation was very helpful in that. \n\nThis is episode 69 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby",
