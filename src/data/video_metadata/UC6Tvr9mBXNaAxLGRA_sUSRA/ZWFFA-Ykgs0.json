 "description": "I was recently asked to respond to these supposed Bible Contradictions. This is my third and last video on this list of contradictions. Here is the link to the list I am responding to: https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/biblical-contradictions/\n\nI hope this may be helpful to someone. I tried to avoid apologizing for these passages or explaining them away. I felt that the article which listed these contradictions was rather disingenuous. If one feels that I improperly addressed these passages, then I would be happy to try to adjust my understanding if reason warrants that.  \n\n*THE THUMBNAIL IMAGE OF THIS VIDEO BELONGS TO THE AMERICAN ATHEISTS ASSOCIATION. IN NO WAY AM I TRYING TO MISREPRESENT THEM WITH THE USE OF THIS IMAGE. \nMake sure to like and subscribe!\n\nCheck out my podcast: Fining Ideas | The Colton Kirby Show: https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\n--Links--\nMy Website: https://www.coltonkirby.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nParler: https://parler.com/profile/coltonkirby/posts\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/coltonjkirby/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_coltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/\nQuora: https://www.quora.com/profile/Colton-Kirby-7",
