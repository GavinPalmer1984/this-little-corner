I forgot to mention this in the video, but everyone should make an effort to read this book. I don't really talk about the book as such here because it's hard to put Frankl's ideas any better than he puts them. \n\nThis video, therefore, is mostly on the connections between Viktor Frankl, Jordan Peterson, and Christianity. Not really sure where these ideas will take me, but it's interesting to ponder. \n\nThis is episode 40 of my podcast.\n\nCheck out my podcast: \nApple:
