 "description": "This is is my conversation with professor Michael Jahosky. Michael is a Tolkien scholar and author of the book \"The Good News of the Return of the King: The Gospel in Middle Earth.\" We talk about Michael's life, the overview and thesis of Michael's book, and in which way (exactly) Middle Earth is a real place. I was delighted that I was able to talk with professor Jahosky and have learned much from him over the last year from his book and podcast. \n\nMichael's book (leave a review on Amazon for him!): https://www.amazon.com/Good-News-Return-King-Middle-earth/dp/1725263165/\nMichael's podcast: https://anchor.fm/michael-t-jahosky\n\nThis was recorded on May 27th, 2022. \n\nThis is episode 84 of my podcast. \n\nMy Writing: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/\n\nThere is an audio version of my videos (on all podcast platforms): https://anchor.fm/coltonkirby\n\nAbout Me: https://coltonkirby.substack.com/about\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_coltonkirby\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialcoltonkirby\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129883782-colton-kirby\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialcoltonkirby/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/coltonjkirby/_saved/\nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@ColtonKirby\nBooks Wish List: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GTqvKmd3Ter2WCpBwU2DkuD-Qse6xiLAqJFGZzWToo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you want to financially support what I\u2019m doing, you can give one-off donations here (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/ColtonKirby",
