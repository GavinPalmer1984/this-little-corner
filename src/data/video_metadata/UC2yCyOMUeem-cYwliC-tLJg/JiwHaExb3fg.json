Is Jordan Peterson a Christian?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwHaExb3fg", "date": "2019-04-22", "description": "Paul Vanderklay was a simple pastor of a small church in California. Now he's considered the pastor of the Intellectual Dark Web. \n\nHis Youtube talks about Jordan Peterson, Christian theology, and what's happening in our present day meaning-crisis started drawing tens of thousands of views, and even garnered the attention of Jordan Peterson himself who came on Paul's program to talk about these deep ideas.\n\nIn our conversation together, we discuss the rise of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon, why people are so desperately searching for meaning in America today, the \"Intellectual Dark Web\", and we'll give a nuanced treatment to the question many people ask- \"Is Jordan Peterson a Christian?\"\n\nYou can check out Paul Vanderklay's Youtube channel at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg\n\nYou can also listen to audio only
