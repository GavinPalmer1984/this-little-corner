If you haven't already, you may want to listen to Episode 27 (which is part 1) first.\n\nIn today's episode, we'll explore three options for how Christians may relate to culture. These three mediating options are alternatives to the extreme  \"Christ against Culture\" & \"Christ of Culture\" theologies (which was covered in part 1).\n\nYou can financially support Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nYou can subscribe on Apple Podcasts at:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nIf you enjoy this podcast, please consider leaving a review on Apple Podcasts!",
