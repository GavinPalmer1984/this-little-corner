 "description": "Those of you who have been following my podcast for a while know that I've been fascinated by the work of  @John Vervaeke  . John and I have had a couple public dialogues, and I've also done several lectures on the points of intersection between Vervaeke's work (and the broader insights of cognitive science) and Christian theology.\nI thought I would do some shorter videos exploring some of those points of intersection. \nIn this video, I'll discuss the work of philosopher & Eastern Orthodox theologian, David Bentley Hart in his \"The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss\" and how it potentially intersects with John Vervaeke's work as a cognitive scientist in his \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\" lecture series.\nWe'll talk about Verveake's concepts of radical de-centering, exaptation, mystical experiences, and consider how the Slain Lamb that John the Revelator pictures enthroned above the cosmos is the prototype for a new kind of human community...dare I even say a new kind of creation.\n\n____________\nAbout me:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n____________\n\nHere's a video of my first conversation with John Vervaeke:\nhttps://youtu.be/7xX7DWZjmFc\n\nAnd a video of my second conversation with him:\nhttps://youtu.be/RUWK1WJZH_w\n\n\nFor the Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making audio podcast:\nhttps://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTo support my channel and podcast:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcas\n\n\nFor John Vervaeke's \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\" series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\n \n\nConnect with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
