In today's episode, we'll explore the afterlife terminology of the Bible and address some of the common misconceptions most people have about what these words mean. We'll try to understand the original context and culture of the Scriptures and see how different the original audience would have understood stories like the parable of \"Lazarus and the rich man\" or Jesus' warnings about the fires of \"hell\" compared to our common modern interpretations of those texts.\n\nThis is stuff no one had clearly explained to me in decades of going to church!\n\nWe'll also cover:\n-the influence of books written in between the Old Testament and New Testament on the worldview of 1st-century people\n\n-the Biblical connection between the fall of angels and Greek myths about the Titans\n\n-How it can make total sense for Jesus to tell the thief on the cross that \"today\" he'd be with Him in \"paradise\" and yet tell Mary Magdelene after the Resurrection that He hadn't gone to his Father in heaven yet\n\nand much more!\n\n \n\nConsider becoming a patron by supporting Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making on
