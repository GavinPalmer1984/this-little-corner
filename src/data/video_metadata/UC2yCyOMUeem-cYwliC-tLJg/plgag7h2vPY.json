 "description": "Hey friends,\nIn nearly 4 years of recording these sorts of long-form discussions, I can honestly say that this was one of the best conversations I've ever had. I struggled to even give it a title. I've posted a couple clips from the last time we all chatted together in May of 2021, but this brand new convo (January 2022) only builds upon that foundation.\n\nI never want to hype something up, so please trust me when I say that you'll really want to watch or listen to this whole thing. The crescendo of where we get to by the end together is still stirring my heart now. Long time listeners to Deep Talks know each of these gentlemen, but if you're new to the channel/podcast they are:\n\nAndy Squyres is a singer-songwriter, author & pastor from Charlotte, North Carolina best known for his song Cherry Blossoms. Andy recently released a masterful record entitled Poet Priest as well as a new book filled with collection of essays, poetry, and images entitled \"Poet Priest, Vol. 1\"\n\nJohn Mark McMillan is a Platinum-selling songwriter & artist best known for his songs How He Loves, Future/Past, & King of My Heart.\n\nTed Kim is senior pastor of Evanston Vineyard. He did his undergrad degree at the University of Chicago and has Masters of Divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\n__________\nAbout:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n\nSince 2017, he's hosted a podcast called \"Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making\" available wherever you subscribe to podcasts.",
