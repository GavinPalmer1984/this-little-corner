 "description": "I talk with Adam Russell (an executive leader in the Vineyard Movement- USA) about my unique synthesis of cultural theology with the work on cultural values done by the late social psychologist, Geert Hofstede.\n\nHow might understanding how values & guiding stories emerge among micro-cultures and dominant, macro-cultures help us to understand the increasingly divisive CULTURE WAR in America? What role did Christians (and in particular, Evangelical Christians) play in the 80's and 90's in the culture war, and how did that eventually set the stage for things like the January 6, 2020 Capitol Riots?\n\nHow is LITURGY happening everywhere shaping our desires and rewriting our guiding stories?\n\n#theologyandculture #culturaltheology #hofstede\n\n\nTo support this channel and the Deep Talks podcast:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n-------------------------------------------\nAbout:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n\nSince 2017, he's hosted a podcast called \"Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making\" available wherever you subscribe to podcasts.",
