(audio only podcast)\n\nIn today's episode, we'll explore perspectives contained in the Old Testament and New Testament for why there is evil and suffering the world and how to respond. We'll examine several possibilities for why there seems to be a stark contrast between the Old Testament & New Testament on who causes these things.\n\nWe'll also explore books written between the Old & New Testament found in the Dead Sea Scrolls which were important in Jewish thought in the 1st Century and may give us clues as to how the worldview of New Testament authors seems so different in many regards compared to the Old Testament authors. These wild intertestamental stories tell of fallen angels, Nephilim giants, Satan, final judgement, and the deception of humanity.\n\nTo Subscribe on Apple
