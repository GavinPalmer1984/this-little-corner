 "description": "Let's use Star Wars to learn a bit about ethics. In this video, we'll compare the virtue ethics of Luke Skywalker to the deontological ethics of the Jedi (Clone Wars era) and the consequentialist ethics of the Sith to understand why we find Luke compelling as a moral exemplar and hero.\n\n_________________\nMembers of the Deep Talks Patreon Community receive bonus Q & A Episodes, articles, charts, forum discussions, and access to regular Group Discussions on Zoom.
