 "description": "Is there a problem with our theology if it doesn't make us more Christ-like?\n\nThat question lead my guest, Bruxy Cavey, on personal and theological journey into the Anabaptist tradition.\nBruxy is the senior pastor at The Meeting House in Ontario, Canada which is one of Canada's largest churches. An Anabaptist mega-church? Yes, that is a unique as it sounds.\n\nBruxy is also the author of the best-selling books Reunion: The Good News of Jesus for Seekers, Saints, & Sinners and The End of Religion: Encountering the Subversive Spirituality of Jesus.\n\nIn today's episode, I talk with Bruxy about:\n\n-his unique journey of faith\n-what makes the Anabaptist tradition unique & controversial\n- the history of the \"Radical Reformation\" and why Anabaptists were killed for their beliefs by other Christians\n-Tough questions about the Anabaptist commitment to non-violence & other challenges\n\nAnd more!\n\nFind out more about Bruxy at:\nhttp://www.bruxy.com/\n\nFor more info on the Jesus Collective or The Meeting House go to:\nhttps://jesuscollective.com/\nhttps://www.themeetinghouse.com/\n\n\nTo become a Deep Talks Patreon member and support this podcast go to:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nListen/Subscribe on Apple Podcasts go to:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\n \n\nConnect on with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
