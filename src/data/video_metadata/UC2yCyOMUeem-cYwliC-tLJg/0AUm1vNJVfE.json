Invisible \"spirits\" have always been on top of a hierarchy of culture dictating our entire way of life. From ancient Babylon to modern-day America, we'll explore the fascinating connection between the domain of \"spirit\" and how this spiritual realm is made manifest in our art, movies, music, economics & politics.\n\nPlus:\n-The connection between national flags and ancient idols\n\n-Why early Christians didn't understand violent passages in the Old Testament the same way we usually do today\n\n-Why American Jazz & Blues might actually be a perfect model for doing cultural theology\n\n-The importance of getting exposed to other cultures & denominations in order to make sure you're aren't secretly worshipping other gods\n\nFor our supporters on Patreon, make sure to go download the free graphic that will help you unpack the ideas in this episode even better!\n\nDownload that
