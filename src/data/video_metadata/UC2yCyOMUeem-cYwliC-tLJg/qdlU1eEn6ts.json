 "description": "Dr. Glenn Packiam is a pastor, theologian, and author. He has a Doctorate in Theology and Ministry from Durham University in the UK and is currently the lead pastor at New Life Downtown in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nGlenn's new book Blessed, Broken, Given: How Your Story Becomes Scared in the Hands of Jesus lays out a wonderful vision of what \"sacramental theology\" is all about (which I've talked about several times in past episodes, most prominently in Episode 17: Understand Our Meaning Crisis PT. 2). We discuss our unique spiritual and theological journeys together, and what he describes as the three \"movements\" of a sacramental life - blessed, broken, and given.\n\nYou can pre-order his new book at:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Blessed-Broken-Given-Becomes-Sacred/dp/052565075X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MSCGXF2BSH8C&keywords=blessed+broken+given&qid=1559256534&s=gateway&sprefix=blessed+broken%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-1\n\n \n\nConnect with Glenn on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/gpackiam\n\nConsider becoming a patron by supporting Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nYou can subscribe on Apple Podcasts at:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nSubscribe to the Deep Talks YouTube page for exclusive video content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2yCyOMUeem-cYwliC-tLJg",
