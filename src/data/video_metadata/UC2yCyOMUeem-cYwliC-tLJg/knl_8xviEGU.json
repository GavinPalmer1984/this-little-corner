 "description": "Dr. Dwight N. Hopkins was born and raised in the segregated south, but through the support system of his loving family and the African American church community, he grew to become a renowned theologian. Hopkins is the Alexander Campbell Professor of Theology at the University of Chicago Divinity School. Graduating from Harvard, Hopkins went on to earn PhD's from Union Seminary and the University of Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nThose of you who listen to this program regularly know that I have credited Dr. Hopkins as being the one who's work first exposed me to the idea of culture as spirit, aesthetic, and labor. \n\nIn today's conversation, I talk with Dr. Hopkins about:\n-his personal journey of faith and calling into theology\n\n-how his experiences in African American church communities shaped his interest in cultural theology\n\n-culture as spirit, aesthetic, and labor; and if \"spirits\" aren't just psychologically symbolic\n\n-how he would theologically and personally evaluate the recent phenomenon of the tearing down statues and monuments throughout America (his answer surprised me!)\n\n-and more!\n\nThis summer, Deep Talks is trying to reach a goal of 300 patrons on Patreon to sustain weekly, ad-free episodes.
