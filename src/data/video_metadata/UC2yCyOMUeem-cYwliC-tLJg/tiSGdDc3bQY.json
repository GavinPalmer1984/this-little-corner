want to invite you to share with me your observations in the comments. \nWhat do you see as the points of harmony and dissonance between Peterson & Walton on Genesis 1?\n\nWhat do you make of each of their hermeneutics?\n\n#jordanpeterson #jordanpetersonlecture #scienceandreligion #bible\nHere's a relevant clip of my past conversation with Dr. John Walton:\nhttps://youtu.be/TW3tX4bPM2Q\n\nTo
