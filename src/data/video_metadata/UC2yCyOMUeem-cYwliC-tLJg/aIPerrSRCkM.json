 "description": "Do you have questions about the theological compatibility of the Christian message with evolutionary science?\n\n \n\nDr. Jim Stump is the Vice President of BioLogos, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping \"the church and the world\nto see the harmony between science and biblical faith as we present an evolutionary understanding of God\u2019s creation.\"\n\nIn this episode, I talk with Dr. Jim Stump about the common theological questions people have about \"evolutionary creationism.\"\n\nSome of these questions include:\n- What is evolutionary creationism, and why do the people at BioLogos believe it to be true?\n\n-If the death of plants, animals, and even human species have been going on long before any sort of historical Adam or Eve, then when was creation ever good?\n\n-Were Neanderthals \"image bearers\"? What makes human's unique made in the image of God?\n\n-Did Satan corrupt the process of evolution, or is this what God really intended?\n\nPlus many more questions!\n\n-At what point was God's creation ever really \"good\" if we had death, violence, and cataclysmic events that killed most living things in the past?\n\nYou can find out more about BioLogos at:\nwww.biologos.org\n\nTo become a Deep Talks Patreon member and support this podcast go to:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nListen/Subscribe on Apple Podcasts go to:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\n \n\nConnect on with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
