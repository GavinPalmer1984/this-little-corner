 "description": "Today's episode comes from a conversation I had with Paul Vander Klay for his YouTube Channel and Podcast. I first had Vander Klay on my podcast back in Episode 18, and he wanted to bring me on his program to discuss possible insights from my background and experiences into the \"meaning-crisis.\" It's a subject we are both passionate about helping others navigate thru.\u00a0\nVanderklay somehow pulled out of me some stories about my experiences deep in the Charismatic & Pentecostal tradition that I've never publicly talked about before. I talk with him about growing up in Benny Hinn meetings, revivals breaking out in my small Christian school, journeys in the 24-7 prayer movement, & strange Charismatic phenomenon I've seen like gold dust, people claiming to be \"drunk in the Spirit\" or even \"high\" on \"toking the Ghost.\"\n\nBeing a Dutch Reformed pastor, he was fascinated by all this :)\u00a0\n\nPlus:\n\nwhat does it mean to experience or commune with God?\n\nCan we say certain things are not valid ways of experience God?\n\nWhat's the difference between the Eucharist and eating bread and wine at Olive Garden?\n\nHow has the Jordan Peterson phenomenon opened people up to these sorts of questions again? (this is an area of expertise for Paul Vanderklay)\n\n\n\nThere is also an audio only podcast versionof this conversation available at:\nwww.deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com\n\nFind out more about Paul Vander Klay at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg\n\nTHIS PODCAST IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE DEEP TALKS PATREON COMMUNITY!\n\nTo become a Deep Talks Patreon member and support this podcast go to:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nListen/Subscribe on Apple Podcasts go to:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nConnect on with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
