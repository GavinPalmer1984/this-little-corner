Most Christians who aren't Catholic or Eastern Orthodox can trace their theological influence directly back to Martin Luther and John Calvin. Luther and Calvin are not only a couple of the most important theologians who have ever lived, but they are among the most controversial... even within Protestant circles! Luther and Calvin both believed they were reclaiming historic Augustinian Christianity from the corrupt Roman Catholic church, arguing for God's predetermining of all things even evil, suffering, and the damnation of the wicked. But were they right?\u00a0\nDon't make up your mind until you've heard their explanations.\n\u00a0\nTODAY's EPISODE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY:\nShema Apparel:\nhttps://shemaapparel.com/\n\nDeep Talks
