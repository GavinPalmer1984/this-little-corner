thought it might be helpful for me to share a basic introductory primer on how the Bible (specifically John 1) uses that concept and applies it to Christ in some very profound (and controversial) ways.\n\nThis is from a talk I gave in August of 2021 on the unique contributions of John's Gospel to the New Testament portrait of Jesus.\n\n-----\nAbout:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n\nFor the past 3.5 years, he's hosted a podcast called \"Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making\" available wherever you subscribe to podcasts.\n\n\nhttps://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTo support this channel and the Deep Talks
