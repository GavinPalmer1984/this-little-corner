His work has been all over the media including CNN, BBC News, CBS News, Men's Health Magazine and more.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this conversation, we'll explore subjects like:\n-why America is experiencing a meaning-crisis while many poorer nations report much lower suicide rates and much higher scores in personal meaning and happiness\n\n- the science behind the growing fascination with ghosts, the paranormal, and aliens & whether there are substitute religions for \"secular\" people\n\n-the link between experiencing despair & one's openness to transcendent sources of meaning\n\n- the difference between \"intuitive\" thinking and rational thinking and how they relate to art, music, and religious experience\n\n-how movie and tv \"reboots\", revived interest among Russians in vintage Soviet Union era merchandise, and other forms of nostalgia are attempts at recovering a sense of meaning & purpose\n\nand much more fascinating stuff!!\n\nYou can check out more of Dr. Clay Routledge's work
