He's published groundbreaking research on the cognitive science of \"meaning.\" His popular \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\" lecture series is a massive 50 part video & podcast series with well over 1 million total views on YouTube. In this series, Vervaeke weaves together insights from cognitive science, biology, philosophy, theology, and history to try and help people understand how we've arrived at our current cultural meaning crisis in the West and what he thinks can be done about it.\n\nIt really is impossible to give a succinct summary of everything that we discuss together in this extended episode, but what I can say is that it was one of the more mind-blowing and insightful conversations I feel like I've had on this podcast. Plus, it was so great to have such a meaningful discussion with someone who would not profess to share my Christian convictions. Hopefully, we've modeled a way of dialogue together that shows that we can respect each other's convictional differences and still be open to learning from each other. \n\nYou can check out John Vervaeke's \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\" lecture series here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\n\nFor the audio podcast of this episode-\nhttps://www.podbean.com/eu/pb-cuaty-f7d11a\n\nIf you find this podcast to be helpful and you want to see it continue ad-free, would you consider becoming a supporter on Patreon?\n\nMembers of the Deep Talks Patreon Community receive bonus Q & A Episodes, articles, charts, forum discussions and more.
