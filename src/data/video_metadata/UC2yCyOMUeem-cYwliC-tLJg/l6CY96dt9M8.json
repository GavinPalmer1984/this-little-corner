He also lectures at London School of Theology. \nWe both share deep roots in the Charismatic and Pentecostal traditions, while also being the rare breeds that went on to get advanced degrees in academic theology.\n\nWhy does it seem like Evangelicals tend to make \"Disney World\" music? Is art the best expression of theology? Is Netflix better at giving sermons than preachers?\n\n#ancientfutureworship \n\nYou can listen to an extended version of our conversation together
