Composer for Terrance Malick | When Beauty Disarms our Cynicism", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxq1LOvXKkg", "date": "2021-04-07", "description": "Jon Guerra is a singer-songwriter based in Austin, Texas. His album Keeper of Days is a brilliant work of \"devotional music\" that's among one of my favorite records in recent years.  He also composes music for the soundtracks of Terrance Malick films.\n\nIn today's episode, I talk with Jon about his spiritual journey and what drew him to music, what once caused him to become cynical about God and music, and what brought him back to his calling.\nWhat is it about an experience of beauty that disarms our cynicism and invites us into a journey of wonder with God?\n\nYou can find out more about Jon Guerra at:\nhttps://www.jonguerramusic.com/\n\nListen to Keeper of Days on Spotify at:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/0flP7iXzaUHPPyOeizocTn?si=2YXkF7GdSEONwUqrzq1jZw\n\nIf you find this podcast to be helpful and you want to see it continue ad-free, would you consider becoming a supporter on Patreon?\n\nMembers of the Deep Talks Patreon Community receive bonus Q & A Episodes, articles, charts, forum discussions and more.
