But is the \"war between faith and science\" really necessary? Is there really even a war?\n\n In this series, we'll explore questions like:\n-Can I reconcile modern geology and biology with the book of Genesis?\n-What does it mean to read the Bible \"literally\" and have I really been reading the Bible the right way?\n-Is there a global bias among scientists against Christianity?\n-Is there such a thing as \"theology-less\" science?\n-Do I really have to choose between Darwin or Jesus?\n\nIn this first episode, Paul will share a bit of his own journey growing up as a Young Earth creationist and explore why learning how to take Biblical inspiration seriously might radically change the way you answer these questions.", "duration": 2965, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "you're listening to deep talks exploring", "start": 0.439, "duration": 5.151}, {"text": "theology and meeting", "start": 3.449, "duration": 4.69}, {"text": "the podcasts dedicated to explore the", "start": 5.59, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "intersection of the", "start": 8.139, "duration": 4.701}, {"text": "with all of our painting", "start": 10.19, "duration": 5.05}, {"text": "I'm your host Paul and like that thanks", "start": 12.84, "duration": 4.83}, {"text": "for listening today's episode we're", "start": 15.24, "duration": 4.89}, {"text": "diving into part one of what's going to", "start": 17.67, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "be a long series exploring issues", "start": 20.13, "duration": 6.71}, {"text": "related to faith science the Bible", "start": 23.43, "duration": 6.41}, {"text": "evolution", "start": 26.84, "duration": 3.0}, {"text": "stay tuned hey everyone welcome to deep", "start": 31.32, "duration": 8.43}, {"text": "talks a podcast that explores theology", "start": 35.88, "duration": 6.18}, {"text": "and meaning-making I'm your host Paul", "start": 39.75, "duration": 3.989}, {"text": "Anne Lightner and I want to thank you", "start": 42.06, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "all of you that reached out to me during", "start": 43.739, "duration": 5.191}, {"text": "the first series and provide such", "start": 46.5, "duration": 5.37}, {"text": "valuable feedback on the the stuff that", "start": 48.93, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "you were learning in the first series", "start": 51.87, "duration": 6.78}, {"text": "and offered some just great insights", "start": 54.93, "duration": 5.61}, {"text": "your own perspectives in this subject", "start": 58.65, "duration": 4.02}, {"text": "matter and that stuff really excites me", "start": 60.54, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "that's what this is all about", "start": 62.67, "duration": 4.229}, {"text": "immediately the first series where I was", "start": 64.46, "duration": 5.049}, {"text": "exploring some of the the theology or at", "start": 66.899, "duration": 4.761}, {"text": "least the theological implications of", "start": 69.509, "duration": 4.831}, {"text": "Jordan Peterson's message was admittedly", "start": 71.66, "duration": 6.43}, {"text": "a pretty maybe a niche topic right you", "start": 74.34, "duration": 5.73}, {"text": "know you probably only had interest in", "start": 78.09, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "it if you had some sort of prior", "start": 80.07, "duration": 6.39}, {"text": "experience or curiosity with dr.
