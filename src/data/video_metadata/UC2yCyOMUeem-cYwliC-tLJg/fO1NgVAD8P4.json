If this is true, why are there such diverse opinions among Christians about how we are to live in the world? In America alone, you bump into MAGA/Trump-loving Christians and Woke Progressive Christians with preferred pronouns. How can this be?At least one factor that contributes to this, is an easy Bible-reading mistake that gives people an imaginary Jesus instead of the Jesus of the Gospels. It's a simple mistake I made for years too, but I think there's a better way.\n\u00a0\nIf you want to support this podcast and become a member of the Deep Talks Patreon Community, go to this
