 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apf-Zh0wCs0",
 "date": "2019-05-09",
 "description": "(audio only) When I recorded with Dan Kent for Greg Boyd's Apologies & Explanations, the primary focus they wanted to bring me on for was to discuss my perspective on the meaning-crisis & science/faith issues, but Dan had a bunch of other great questions for me too. Some of them were on the more speculative side of theology including questions about consciousness & this thing called panpsychism, open theism, and other fun stuff. We went for about 2 hours together talking about all this fun and important stuff!\n\nSo the primary episode we both released last week contained about 45 minutes of my interview, but Dan still thought the other points of discussion were really informative and helpful so he chopped up some of the highlights and put together a bonus episode they shared on Reknew.org.\n\nI really enjoyed this discussion and I think some of the topics we covered could be helpful for others processing some of these questions, so I thought I would put it out to share with you.\n\nIn this episode, I share some of my thoughts on:\n\n-Greg Boyd's work\n\n-the pros and cons of Charismatic & Pentecostal theology\n\n-some brief (and unplanned!) reflections on open theism\n\n-politics, war, & following Jesus\n\n-consciousness, panpsychism, and \"prophetic\" dreams\n\n-reading Genesis with ancient eyes\n\n- and more!\n\n \n\nConsider becoming a patron by supporting Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nYou can also listen on iTunes at:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159",
