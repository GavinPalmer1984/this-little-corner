 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE130bXDHro",
 "date": "2023-03-28",
 "description": "Has the archetypal cowboy hero of the Western film corrupted American religion and infected generations of Christian men with toxic masculinity, or is the role of these formative stories and heroes more complicated?\n\nWhat should we make of the relationship between Jesus and John Wayne? Dr. Chris Green joins me today to help us wrestle with the complexity of these issues and the important ramifications of our culture's guiding stories on how we read the Bible, do politics, think about the role of police and soldiers, and how we rightly esteem heroes.\n\nChris Green is Professor of Public Theology at Southeastern University (Lakeland, FL) and Director for St Anthony Institute of Theology, Philosophy, and Liturgics. He is the author and editor of a number of books, including most recently All Things Beautiful: An Aesthetic Christology.\n\nhttps://www.cewgreen.com/\n\n_________\n\nIf you find this podcast helpful and want to see it continue ad-free, would you consider becoming a supporter on Patreon?
