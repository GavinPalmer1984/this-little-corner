 "description": "For the past 3 years I have focussed my work on long form conversations with theologians, scientists, authors, and artists, as well as thoroughly prepared lectures on the intersection of theology & meaning-making via my podcast \"Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making\".\n\nI'm experimenting today with a bit of an \"off the cuff\", theological reaction video to the recent conversation released on @Jordan B Peterson channel with @John Vervaeke @Bishop Robert Barron & @Jonathan Pageau . This is part 1. We'll see how many of these I do. I welcome your engagement.\n\nHere's a video of my first conversation with John Vervaeke:\nhttps://youtu.be/7xX7DWZjmFc\n\nAnd a video of my second conversation with him:\nhttps://youtu.be/RUWK1WJZH_w\n\nIf you are interested in my 3 part lecture series entitled \"Jesus and John Vervaeke\" start here:\nhttps://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-p9pth-10acee7",
