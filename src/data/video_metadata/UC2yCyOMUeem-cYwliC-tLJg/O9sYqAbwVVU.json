 "description": "Patrick Miller is the co-author of Truth Over Tribe: Pledging Allegiance to the Lamb, Not the Donkey or the Elephant, and in today's episode we discuss some of the scientific and social factors that are contributing to the intense tribal polarization in America.\n\nHow does the Culture War make Truth a casualty? How might Christians learn from our past mistakes and offer a better way forward? How can we navigate politically charged conversations with friends, family, and neighbors more effectively?\n\nYou can pick up Patrick Miller and Keith Simon's book here: https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Over-Tribe-Pledging-Allegiance/dp/0830784780\n\nCheck out Truth Over Tribe's podcast and blog at:\n\nchoosetruthovertribe.com\n\nYou can purchase my debut book Dis-Ordered: A Christian Journey Through the Problem of Evil & Suffering here:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBYBWWXR\n\n________\n\nIf you find this podcast to be helpful and you want to see it continue ad-free, would you consider becoming a supporter on Patreon?\n\nMembers of the Deep Talks Patreon Community receive bonus Q & A Episodes, articles, charts, forum discussions and access to regular Group Discussions on Zoom.
