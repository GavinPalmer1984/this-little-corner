 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAjItrLDoSU",
 "date": "2019-05-07",
 "description": "(audio only)\n\nIn the second part of \"Understanding Our Meaning Crisis\" we'll explore how in a secular age, with more and more people claiming to have no religious affiliation, people are actually just as religious as they've ever been.\n\nWe'll talk about why no one is actually an atheist, and how an NFL game might not be all that different from an ancient pagan ritual.\n\nAre things like Comic Con, Politics, & Netflix actually religious experience? Have we confused worshipping God with worshipping our country & the State?\n\nFinally, we'll explore how a \"sacramental\" view of the world may actually be the antidote to our meaning-crisis, and I'll offer some practical strategies for living \"sacramentally\" in our secular age.\n\n \n\nTo support this podcast and the other video content I'm creating on YouTube, become a patron support on Patreon here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nTo subscribe on iTunes/Apple go to:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nThis podcast is also available on Spotify, Google Podcasts, and most other podcast platforms",
