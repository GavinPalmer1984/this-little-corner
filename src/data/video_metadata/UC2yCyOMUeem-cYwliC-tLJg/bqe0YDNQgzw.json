All of my Deep Talks interview videos will be moving over to my Patreon page while I use this space to primarily focus on videos that explore philosophy & theology embedded in popular culture through film, television, comics, etc.\n\nThis clip comes from this week's episode \"A Quest for Meaning as a Spiritual Species\" featuring Dr. Clay Routledge and Ben Wilterdink.\n\nBecome a patron and watch the full, unedited conversation on my Patreon page here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast",
