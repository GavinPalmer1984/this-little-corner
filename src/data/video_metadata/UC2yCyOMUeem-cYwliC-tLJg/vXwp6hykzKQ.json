 "description": "EPISODE 27- CHRIST & CULTURE PART 1: FROM JESUS FREAKS TO CHRISTIAN NAZIS (audio only)\n\nDid you have to listen to D.C. Talk growing up because your church didn't let you listen to Nirvana? Why do some churches hang gay pride flags in front of their building while other churches preach that homosexuality is a sin? Did the author of John's Gospel do something wrong when he borrowed an idea from Greek philosophy and applied it to Christ? How could German Christians in the 1930s ever become Nazis?\n\nAnswering these kinds of questions requires us to answer even deeper questions- how should Christians relate to their surrounding culture? Where can Christ be found in culture? Can He be found there at all?\n\nTheology of culture is a relatively new theological discipline and if you've never explored it before you might not think it's that big of a deal, but I promise you that it's actually one of the most important areas of theology that you'll ever explore.\n\nWhat you believe about this affects the music and entertainment choices you make, who you'll marry and how you'll raise your kids; it affects your views on science and morality, the church you choose to attend, and even your political perspective.\n\nFrom D.C. Talk to Christian Nazis, we'll explore it all!\n\nYou can financially support Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nYou can subscribe on Apple Podcasts at:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nIf you enjoy this podcast, please consider leaving a review on Apple Podcasts!",
