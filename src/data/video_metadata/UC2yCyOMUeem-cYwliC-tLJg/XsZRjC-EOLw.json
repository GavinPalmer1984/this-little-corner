 "description": "Would a corporate ethics or emotional intelligence employee training course from a healthy American company work aboard a Klingon \"Bird of Prey\" ship in Star Trek? Probably not. (Don't worry, you don't have to be a Trekkie to understand the thought experiment in today's video!)\nThat's because, whether we are aware of it or not, there is an assumed narrative structure in our culture that informs our ethical norms. But we bump up against a real problem in postmodernism with the claim that any transcultural, overarching guiding story is an attempt to colonize other cultures and that ethics can only be relativistic cultural guidelines . If this is true, would we every be able to say that particular ethical norms in the fictional Klingon or the ancient Spartan culture are wrong?\n\nIn my last conversation with @John Vervaeke and @Paul VanderKlay , John brought up a sincere concern about Christianity as a force of cultural assimilation. To use Star Trek lingo, does Christianity function like the Borg?\nOr do we need to distinguish between Christendom and The Way of Jesus?\n\n#culturaltheology #theologyofculture #startrek #scienceandfaith\n\nTo support this channel and podcast on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/61462284\n\n_________________________\nABOUT:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n\nSince 2017, he's hosted a podcast called \"Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making\" helping people explore the intersection of theology with all of our efforts to find and make meaning in the world.\nAvailable wherever you subscribe to podcasts.",
