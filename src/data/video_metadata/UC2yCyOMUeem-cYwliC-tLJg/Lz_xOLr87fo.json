 "description": "In part 3 of \"The Problem of Evil\", we'll explore the first two centuries of church history where Gnosticism and Marcionism provided a challenging alternative to genuine Christianity. One of the significant appeals of these movements was how they answered the problem of evil and explained the causations for suffering. In the face of these challenges and the threat of martyrdom, early church leaders like Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus provided crucial responses to these challenges and key insights into how early Christians understood the root causes of evil and unjust suffering.\n\nTo Subscribe on Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nTo become a Deep Talks Patreon member and support this podcast go to:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast",
