part 4 of our series surrounding issues relating to Christian theology and science, we'll explore why there is no such thing as \"theology-less\" science.\n\nDespite the claims of many naturalists to the \"objectivity\" of science,  we'll discuss why there is no \"neutral\" position when it comes the subject of God and science.\n\nWe'll also explore the theological influences on Charles Darwin and try to understand why Darwinian language isn't theologically neutral. \n\nFinally, we'll consider why humility, honest inquiry, and open dialogue among differing perspectives should be welcomed by people who are seriously committed to the meaning-making process.", "duration": 3732, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hey friends after a couple week hiatus", "start": 0.84, "duration": 6.759},
