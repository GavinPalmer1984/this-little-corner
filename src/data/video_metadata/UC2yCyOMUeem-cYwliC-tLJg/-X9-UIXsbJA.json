 "description": "In this week's Reconstruction Story, we'll hear from someone who grew up in fundamentalism, left to pursue New Age spiritualities and psychedelic exploration, and eventually became a holistic follower of the Way of Jesus. And yes, we have some extended conversation about psychedelic drugs because I know so many listeners who have questions on the subject.\n\nMy guest today is Paul Risse. Paul is a husband, father, and a bit of modern Renaissance man. He's a business owner. He builds tiny homes. He's a carpenter, a trainer, a firefighter, and writes about his adventures in the world and what he's learned from them.\n\nYou can follow him on Instagram at instagram.com/paulrisse\n\nI got connected to Paul Risse when he became a member of the Deep Talks Patreon Community.\n\nIf you want to support this podcast and become a member of the Deep Talks Patreon Community, go to this link:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\n \n\nTo Subscribe & Review on Apple Podcasts:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nConnect with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
