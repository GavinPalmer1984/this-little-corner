 "description": "Source:\nhttps://www.podbean.com/eau/pb-h24zt-d206bb\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\nMy guest in today's episode is Justin Brierley. Justin is the longtime host of\u00a0Unbelievable?, an award-winning show in the U.K. where skeptics, atheists, historians, scientists, theologians, and philosophers exchange meaningful conversations about God, Christianity, philosophy, and the big questions of life. Along with\u00a0Unbelievable?,\u00a0 Justin also hosts\u00a0Ask N.T. Wright Anything.\n\u00a0\nIn our conversation together, I talk with Justin about how he began this program and what he's learned in nearly 15 years of hosting the show. Justin discusses a shift he has seen in the last decade with a movement away from the New Atheism of Richard Dawkins into a new curiosity about Christianity and religion sparked by curious agnostics like Jordan Peterson and Tom Holland.\n\u00a0\nFor more information about Justin Brierley,\u00a0Unbelievable?, his book or any of his upcoming events visit:\nhttps://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable\nhttps://www.unbelievable.live/\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714CP5M9/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PremierUnbelievable\n\u00a0\nTODAY'S EPISODE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY:\n\u00a0Deep Talks Patreon Community\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\nBecome a member of the Deep Talks Patreon Community to help support this podcast and receive bonus content, Q & A opportunities, and more!\n\nTo Subscribe & Review on Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\nConnect on with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:https://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
