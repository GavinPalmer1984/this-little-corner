 "title": "Jesus Beats The Universe in an Evolutionary Tournament of the Gods | Jonathan Haidt & Daniel Dennett",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7wGQsiTThg",
 "date": "2022-08-23",
 "description": "In this mini-episode, I wanted to discuss Daniel Dennett's theory of what we could call an \"evolutionary tournament of the gods\" & Jonathan Haidt's work in The Righteous Mind on the positive social value of religion.\n\nIn the waning years of our Secular Age, \"the Universe\" has become a popular euphemism for a sort of mindless \"god\" that is metaphysically necessary but is indifferent and capricious.  Does this Secular God defeat Christian conceptions of God and lead humanity to a utopia of pure rationalism like Dennett & the New Atheists believe, or is it already proving to be a failure that leaves social groups without moral direction or any reason to selflessly give of themselves for the sake of others?\n\nDoes Jesus beat \"The Universe\" in an evolutionary tournament of the gods?\n\n#JonathanHaidt #evolution #theology #religion \n\n___________\nYou can pre-order my new book (release September '22)\nDis-Ordered: A Christian Journey Through the Problem of Evil and Suffering at\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/paulanleitner\n\n \n\nIf you find this podcast to be helpful and you want to see it continue ad-free, would you consider becoming a supporter on Patreon?\n\nMembers of the Deep Talks Patreon Community receive bonus Q & A Episodes, articles, charts, discussion forums and more.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\nTo Subscribe & Review on Apple Podcasts:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\n\n \n\nConnect with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
