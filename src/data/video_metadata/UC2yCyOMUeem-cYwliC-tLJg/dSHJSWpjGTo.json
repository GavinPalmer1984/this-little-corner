 "description": "SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL AND PODCAST AT:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n--------\nAs storied creatures, humans search for meaning and purpose in their life and the world through stories. In many ways, modern cinema has replaced traditional religious institutions as the primary location people go to in order to find stories that will help them make sense of their lives.\n\nSome of the great movies of our time are deeply embedded with profound theological and philosophical ideas.\n\nIn this series, we'll explore the deep ideas and questions embedded in popular films. First up, is Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, which as we will explore, is filled existential themes and questions borrowed from the likes of Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Soren Kierkegaard\n\nTo subscribe to the audio only version of this podcast go to:\n\nPodbean:\nhttps://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com/\n\nItunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159?mt=2\n\nor your preferred Podcast platform of choice.",
