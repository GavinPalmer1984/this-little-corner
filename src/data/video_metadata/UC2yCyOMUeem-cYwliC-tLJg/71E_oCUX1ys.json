Why did each of them find traditional responses to the problem of evil in various forms of classical theism unsatisfying? What is similar and different about their respective positions?\n\nDoes either Boyd's Open Theism or Oord's Essential Kenosis/God Can't theodicy provide more satisfying answers than what people like Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Leibniz, Barth provided in the past?\n\nHow do they both respond to some of the more challenging theological or philosophical critiques aimed at their ideas?\n\nDr. Gregory A. Boyd is theologian with advanced degrees from Yale and Princeton, senior pastor of Woodland Hills Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, and is author of numerous books. Some of the more relevant books to today's conversation are:\n\nGod of the Possible: A Biblical Introduction to the Open View of God \nGod at War: The Bible and Spiritual Conflict \nSatan & the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare Theodicy\nThe Crucifixion of the Warrior God: Volumes 1 & 2\n\n \nDr. Thomas Jay Oord is a theologian and philosopher with advanced degrees from Nazarene Theological Seminary and Claremont Graduate University.  He directs the doctoral program at Northwind Theological Seminary and the Center for Open and Relational Theology. He's also authored numerous books and articles including:\n\nGod Can't: How to Believe in God and Love After Tragedy, Abuse, and Other Evils \nThe Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence\nDefining Love: A Philosophical, Scientific, and Theological Engagement \n\n#theodicy #theproblemofevil #opentheism #gregboyd #thomasjayoord #theologicaldebate\n\nIf you'd like
