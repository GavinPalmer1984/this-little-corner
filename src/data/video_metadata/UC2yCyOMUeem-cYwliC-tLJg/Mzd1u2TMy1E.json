 "description": "I've been taking some time to do some theological responses to the recent conversation between @Jordan B Peterson @John Vervaeke @Bishop Robert Barron and @Jonathan Pageau .  This is part 3 in that series.\nThere was a section of the conversation I could not neglect. Jordan Peterson thinks the New Testament book of Revelation is the result of a psychedelic experience. Is there evidence to support that claim? And what about his admiration for \"The Immortality Key\" book and the author's claims about Communion wine being a psychedelic mixture?\n\nWhy aren't more Christian theologians grappling with psychedelics and their potentiality for producing transformative, mystical experiences?\n\nFor Part 1:\nhttps://youtu.be/aaOmcgN3_Sc\n\nPart 2:\nhttps://youtu.be/IbhoIOtPZwg\n\nFor my first convo with John Vervaeke:\nhttps://youtu.be/7xX7DWZjmFc\n\n____________\nAbout me:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n____________\n\nFor the Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making audio podcast:\nhttps://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podb...\n\nTo support my channel and podcast:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheo...\n\n \n\nConnect with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:\nhttps://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
