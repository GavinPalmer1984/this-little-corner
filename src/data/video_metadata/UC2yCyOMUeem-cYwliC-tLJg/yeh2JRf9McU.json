John and I have had a couple public dialogues, and I've also done several lectures on the points of intersection between Vervaeke's work (and the broader insights of cognitive science) and Christian theology.\nI thought I would do some shorter videos exploring some of those points of intersection. \nIn this first video we'll discuss \"Frame disruption,\" \"de-centering,\" and Jesus' parables, and also re-contextualize words like \"sin\" and \"repent\" in hopes of better capturing their intended meaning. \n\nI welcome your observations, questions, and objections in the comments.\n____________\nAbout me:\nPaul Anleitner holds degrees in history from the University of Michigan & a Master's in Christian Thought from Bethel Seminary (St. Paul, MN) where he graduated with highest honors.\n\nHe's taught theology, philosophy, and biblical studies courses for over a decade and is a pastor with 15 years of experience working in a variety of denominational contexts.\n____________\n\nFor the Deep Talks: Exploring Theology & Meaning-Making audio podcast:\nhttps://deeptalkstheologypodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTo support my channel and
