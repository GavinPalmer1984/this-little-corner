 "description": "Source:\nhttps://www.podbean.com/eau/pb-ttfre-c99fee\n\nIn part 6 of The Problem of Evil we head into Europe's Middle Ages, a time of horrific moral and natural evils. From plagues to crusades, many superstitious explanations abounded for why these evils occurred.Simultaneously, this was an era filled with significant advancements in the arts and education.\u00a0Arguably the greatest medieval philosopher and theologian, Thomas Aquinas believed that the existence of God was not threatened by the philosophical and theological challenges that evil and suffering presents.\u00a0In this episode, we'll explore his famous \"Five Ways\" or the five logical arguments he thought proved the existence of God. Plus we'll see how Aquinas differed philosophically from Origen and Augustine and how that philosophical difference affected his understanding of evil, suffering, and the fundamental nature of God's creation.\nTODAY's EPISODE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY:\nShema Apparel\nhttps://shemaapparel.com/\nDeep Talks Patreon Communityhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\nBecome a member of the Deep Talks Patreon Community to help support this podcast and receive bonus content, Q &amp; A opportunities, and more!\nTo Subscribe on Apple Podcasts:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159\nConnect on with Paul Anleitner on Twitter at:https://twitter.com/PaulAnleitner",
