Conversation with Micah Redding of Christian Transhumanist Association", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO9_cLjMzVA", "date": "2019-08-05", "description": "Artificial intelligence, gene editing, robot companionship & many more technological changes in our near future present challenges to Christian theology and what it means to be a human. \n\nMy guest, Micah Redding is attempting to bring Christian theology into conversations that have seemed to many to be largely anti-religious. Micah is the Executive Director of the Christian Transhumanist Association.\n\n \n\nWhat is \"transhumanism\"? Micah explains & lays out a theological case for Christians to be leading the way in the transhumanist movement.\n\nPlus many other provoking philosophical and theological challenges such as:\n- Can a machine have a soul or spirit or consciousness?\n\n-Will churches in the near future have to provide ethical instruction for how Christians should treat robots?\n\n-Is Darth Vader \"human\"? What makes us human?\n\n-C.S. Lewis' \"Space Trilogy\", SciFi tv & movies & transhumanism\n\n-Is it \"playing God\" to edit human genes to eliminate diseases & harmful hereditary conditions, or is that part of the Christian calling to act as healers in the world?\n\nAnd much more!!\n\n \n\nFor more info on the Christian Transhumanist Association:\nhttps://www.christiantranshumanism.org/\n\nTo find more of Micah Redding's
