 "description": "Is it possible that we've completely misunderstood the Apostle Paul...and perhaps even the entire Bible as a result? What do these ideas like \"faith and works\" or \"grace vs. the Law\" really mean? Did even Martin Luther and John Calvin misunderstand them?\n\nOur guest in today's conversation is Dr. Matthew J. Thomas. Matthew has Doctor of Philosophy in Theology from the University of Oxford and is an expert in New Testament and early church history. He's written a book that Scott McKnight awarded as one the top 3 theology books of 2018 entitled \"Paul's Works of The Law in the Perspective of Second Century Reception.\" He's taught at St. Patrick's Seminary, Franciscan University, and Regent College.\n\n \n\nYou can purchase Matthew's book here (warning: it is currently at a pretty hefty academic price tag):\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Perspective-Reception-Wissenschaftliche-Untersuchungen-Testament/dp/3161562755/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=matthew+j.+thomas+paul&qid=1554215169&s=gateway&sr=8-1\n\nYou can become a patron supporter on Patreon and ensure that this podcast and the videos we're creating can keep happening here (plus there's a bunch of fun benefits for patrons!):\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeptalkstheologypodcast\n\n \n\nTo Listen/Subscribe on iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-talks-exploring-theology-and-meaning-making/id1401730159?mt=2\n\nDeep Talks also has a YouTube channel with other unique content!
