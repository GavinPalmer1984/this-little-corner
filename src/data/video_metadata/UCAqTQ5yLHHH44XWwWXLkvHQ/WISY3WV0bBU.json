 "description": "The very word \"secrecy\" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. \n\nWe decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. \n\nEven today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. \n\nThat I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. \n\nHere's a Discord for people who don't hate me: https://discord.gg/W8tnFw5t9p\nHere's a Patreon for people who want to encourage me: https://www.patreon.com/grimgriz\n\nhttps://grimgriz.substack.com/",
