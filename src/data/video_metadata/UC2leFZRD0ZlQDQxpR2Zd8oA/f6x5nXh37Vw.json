 "title": "Can Distributism Answer Game B's Questions? pt 3 Hilaire Belloc Describes the Servile State",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6x5nXh37Vw",
 "date": "2020-06-24",
 "description": "In order to understand the operation of a distributed economy (an economy of wide ownership), it is helpful to contrast it with an economy in which the ownership of productive property is concentrated. In his book, The Servile State, Hilaire Belloc uses the historical example of the economy of ancient Rome. This is particularly apt because it is the system out of which a distributed economy arose over the course of the Middle Ages and hence may demonstrate for our purposes how to recover a distributed economy in our time.\n\nThe Servile State on Amazon: https://amzn.to/31bzWcp\n\nHow to pronounce my last name: The \"c\" is silent just to confuse people.\nBringing Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) into the converZation in Paul VanderKlay's little corner of the internet.\nIntroduction to Christianity: https://amzn.to/2A5pvZi\nPope Benedict XVI writings:  https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html \nPaul VanderKlay\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg \nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis (John Vervaeke): https://youtu.be/54l8_ewcOlY\nJohn V. and PVK in conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65CcfvXXHug\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqinRbjqy2c\nRandos United: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzWTLDYmL8soRdQec9Fsjw \nMe on Paul's channel:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN-PQ3uUm4Y\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSiXzJkIj0c\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdlMtQSKszc\nKaren Wong's channel, The Meaning Code: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ\nSevilla King's channel, A Quality Existence: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vg0HkKKlgsWk-3HfV-vnw  \nJonathon Pageau's channel, The Symbolic World: https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan/videos",
