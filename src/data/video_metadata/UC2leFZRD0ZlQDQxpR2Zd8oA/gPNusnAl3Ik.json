 "title": "Can Distributism Answer Game B's Questions? pt 4 Hilaire Belloc Describes the Distributed State",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPNusnAl3Ik",
 "date": "2020-06-28",
 "description": "The operation of a distributed economy (an economy of wide ownership) can be studied historically by looking at the economy built under the influence of the Catholic Church over the course of the Middle Ages and hence may be useful to consider if we wish to recover a distributed economy in our time. Hilaire Belloc describes the gradual abandonment of slavery and the transformation of the Roman villa system into a society of wide economic freedom and dynamism by the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Servile State on Amazon: https://amzn.to/31bzWcp\n\nHow to pronounce my last name: The \"c\" is silent just to confuse people.\nBringing Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) into the converZation in Paul VanderKlay's little corner of the internet.\nIntroduction to Christianity: https://amzn.to/2A5pvZi\nPope Benedict XVI writings:  https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html \nPaul VanderKlay\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg \nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis (John Vervaeke): https://youtu.be/54l8_ewcOlY\nJohn V. and PVK in conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65CcfvXXHug\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqinRbjqy2c\nRandos United: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzWTLDYmL8soRdQec9Fsjw \nMe on Paul's channel:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN-PQ3uUm4Y\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSiXzJkIj0c\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdlMtQSKszc\nKaren Wong's channel, The Meaning Code: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ\nSevilla King's channel, A Quality Existence: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vg0HkKKlgsWk-3HfV-vnw  \nJonathon Pageau's channel, The Symbolic World: https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan/videos",
