 "description": "Widespread industrialization in the later half of the nineteenth century was new, altering ways of life, economic scales, and social structures. It was new enough that Pope Leo XIII\u2019s papal encyclical of 1891, was called Rerum Novarum (Of the new things) and represented the Catholic Church's solicitous perspective on the impact of these changes on ordinary working people. The encyclical prompted decades of thoughtful reflection, policy experiments and practical innovations in business organization and relations between capital, management, and labor.\n\nRERUM NOVARUM, ENCYCLICAL OF POPE LEO XIII ON CAPITAL AND LABOR http://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html\n\nImagined Futures, Douglas Rushkoff & Jamie Wheal on Rebel Wisdom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80PSGLonjUs",
