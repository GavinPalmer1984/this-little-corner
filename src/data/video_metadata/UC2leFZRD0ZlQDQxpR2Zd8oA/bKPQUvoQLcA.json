 "description": "As economic suffering and unemployment soared for millions of Americans, fifty percent of the money the Federal Reserve pumped into the economy to deal with the Covid-19 crisis went to the wealthiest one percent among us, increasing the already obscene wealth gap between the top and bottom.

Inquiring minds wonder if this is capitalism at work, even as minds made up take to the streets to cry for an end to it.\n\nBerkey water filter: https://amzn.to/3fsCirn \n\nFlint water crisis:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iCdkjW4YQ8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlLHXglPfo\n\nUS water crisis:\nhttps://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/translating-uncle-sam/stories/how-polluted-is-us-drinking-water\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/cities-worst-tap-water-us-2019-3\nhttps://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-protect-yourself-lead-contaminated-water\nhttps://silentspring.org/project/disparities-drinking-water-quality-us\nhttps://www.fairwarning.org/2017/12/fluoride-in-the-water/\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fluoride-in-water-worsens-us-lead-crisis-300219061.html\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4697843\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332218374407\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/npjgenmed201618\n\nMaking the rich richer:\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/richest-americans-adding-billions-to-net-worth-2020-4\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/billionaire-wealth-inequality-pandemic-jobs/index.html\n\nDr. Mark Hyman at a black church: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxOxXyx9il4\n\nHow to pronounce my last name: The \"c\" is silent just to confuse people.\nBringing Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) into the converZation in Paul VanderKlay's little corner of the internet.\nIntroduction to Christianity: https://amzn.to/2A5pvZi\nPope Benedict XVI writings:  https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en.html \nPaul VanderKlay\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg \nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis (John Vervaeke): https://youtu.be/54l8_ewcOlY\nJohn V. and PVK in conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65CcfvXXHug\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqinRbjqy2c\nRandos United: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzWTLDYmL8soRdQec9Fsjw \nMe on Paul's channel:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN-PQ3uUm4Y\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSiXzJkIj0c\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdlMtQSKszc\nKaren Wong's channel, The Meaning Code: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ\nSevilla King's channel, A Quality Existence: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vg0HkKKlgsWk-3HfV-vnw  \nJonathon Pageau's channel, The Symbolic World: https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan/videos",
