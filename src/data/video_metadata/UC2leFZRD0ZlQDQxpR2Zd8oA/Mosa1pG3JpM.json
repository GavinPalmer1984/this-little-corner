Thomas Colyandro is the Retreat Director for Mother of God, Joy of All Who Sorrow Monastery in Monteagle, Tennessee. We talk about the desire for community that comes up over and over again in conversations with Paul VanderKlay and in the work of John Vervaeke. Why is this thing that we desire to emerge so organically turn out to be something we have to intentionally craft? Why does our homey vision of being embraced in a circle of loving friends so often shatter into shards of strife and bitterness? What is wrong with us, anyway? Should we still try for community, and if so, how and where? \nFind Fr.
