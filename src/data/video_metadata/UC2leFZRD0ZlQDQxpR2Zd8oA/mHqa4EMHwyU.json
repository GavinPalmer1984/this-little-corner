 "date": "2020-07-04",
 "description": "Having described the achievement of a social organization based upon widespread ownership of property by the end of  the Middle Ages, Hilaire Belloc goes on the describe the tragic end of this arrangement beginning with concentration of property following the dissolution of the monasteries in England. Belloc challenges many of our assumptions about the way an economy must work. We begin to discuss the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity that will frame further discussion of how we can reclaim economic freedom.",
