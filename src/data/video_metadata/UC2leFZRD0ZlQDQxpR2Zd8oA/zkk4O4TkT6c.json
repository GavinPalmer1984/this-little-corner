Lord willing, this is only the first conversation with these smart two men from very different backgrounds and experiences.\n\nLinks and notes forwarded by Tom:\n\nhttps://forums.delphiforums.com/Distributism\n\nA sample of redirecting technology: \nhttps://permies.com/t/54517/ultimate-potential-wheat-straw-construction\n\nI know you have all your favorite homesteading YouTubers, I'll just offer this one for you to consider: Pete, he's a former Architect in upstate NY, in the Beautiful Finger Lakes region (where land is surprisingly cheap). In this video Pete describes opting-out, or his journey back to Distributism: YOU can live your small farm dream! In the long form of Interview Matthew and I did a whole section on Bourgeois and Baroque and Distributism. Matthew's suggestion of a Ghibli movie was about a young man who devotes himself to learning to build masterpiece violins. The concept is to reject the Bourgeois and embrace the Baroque facilitated by a bonded distributist group.  Pete does his version of it here: Our farm's story: frugality, perseverance, and love. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Y68uK5KlU (I'd like to contact Pete and show him how he is a dyed-in-the-wool distributist even though he may never have heard that word.)\n\nI watched your video on Laurel's Kitchen. That inspired this thread on how -- now that we've flushed 36\" of topsoil (plus thousands of tons of agri-poison) into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico -- we might rebuild that topsoil back.
