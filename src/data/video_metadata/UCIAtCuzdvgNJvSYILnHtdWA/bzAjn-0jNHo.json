 "description": "Welcome to the Annus Horribilis 2020. It is clear, as we approach the midway point of the year, that this one is going down in the history books. There are fearful scenarios on the horizon. But even these are only the mildest symptoms of a much larger, much darker event; a New Dark Age. In 1995 I had a radio show in the middle of the night on WFMU which broadcasts to the New York metropolitan area it was called the Prelude To The New Dark Age. I've decided that it's time to revive the title again to begin to look at the Dark Age that is seeping into our lives. Meanwhile Bob Dylan said it best \"The Titanic sails at dawn. Everybody's shouting 'Which side are you on?' \"\n\nHEY! SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY.
