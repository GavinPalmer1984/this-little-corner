 "date": "2019-07-08",
 "description": "So this lecture, entitled Noise Enters Music, is mostly a music history lecture about how noise came into music. And from there how the chaos of noise entered the rest of society... Or maybe I didn't quite extend my thesis that far at the time. This lecture was given at Swiss L'Abri in 2005 on March 2nd. \n\nSome of the topics and names mentioned: John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ornette Coleman, Scott Joplin, Celine Dion, Albert Ayler, Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, Nirvana, Atari Teenage Riot, the Butthole Surfers, Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto, Punk Rock, Free Jazz, Unsane, Pedro The Lion, Romanticism, Modernism, the year 1900, and much more. \n\nAnd this is the TELESCOPED version of the lecture meaning all of the musical examples are contracted. PayPal supporters over $50 dollars at once or as a recurring paymentcan get the whole lecture along with 15 hours of other lectures too loaded with copyrighted content to put on YouTube in its current state. So GIVE... and Get..\nTHE LINK TO CONTRIBUTE...\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne",
