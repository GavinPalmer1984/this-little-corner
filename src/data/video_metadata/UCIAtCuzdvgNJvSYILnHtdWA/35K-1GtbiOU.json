 "description": "Well here's a perspective you might need to hear. An Alaskan friend, a digital hermit, Ashley. We talk about the mass media and endless propaganda. Let Ashley know what you think.\nVisit Ashley's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Hermitlion\nAnd His blog site: https://mindworld.blog/\n......\nPlease donate to this channel through PayPal. \nMore than $50 at once or $10 per month will get you ten hours of AUDIO extras from the Anadromist.\nClick this...    \nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GE5NHN8AYL3YC\n................\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas:  https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nVisit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts.   \n\nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) Thanks for watching, more coming soon! \nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nSwimming Against the Stream\n\nByrne\n\n#alaska #hermits #propaganda",
