 "description": "In a world of propaganda, how do we learn to truly talk with others? How do we leave thoughtful comments that open up conversations rather than shut them down? This time I take aim at the ever present trend surrendering to the propagandistic slap down that manifests itself in hot knee-jerk reactions online. This is essentially a very carefully weighed polemic against ideological possession. Give ear. \n.....\nSince I can't get monetized I need your help.
