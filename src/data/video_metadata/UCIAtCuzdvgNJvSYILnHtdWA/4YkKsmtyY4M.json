 "description": "Our culture encourages us to live against Time. So how do we live within Time? One way is through beginning to understand Memory. And to understand Memory we need a way of understanding Past, Present and Future. And we must seek to become Honest Faithful Witnesses of our own lives, through our memories. This is the eighth in a series of discussions on the importance of Time in our lives. \n\nAnd check out my NEW Georgian channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nYOU CAN SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.
