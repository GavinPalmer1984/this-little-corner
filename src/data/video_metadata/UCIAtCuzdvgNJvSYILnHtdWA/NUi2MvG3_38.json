 "description": "Here is the next in my series of anadromous interviews with Dutch Reformed Minister Paul VanderKlay. I decided that since Paul conducts many interviews where he listens to folks tell there stories I figured it might be helpful to turn the tables on Paul and get his story.  If you are a long time PVK listener or just visiting this channel I'm sure you'll find his life well worth a listen.\nAlso you should visit his channel sometime:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/PaulVanderKlay\n......\nPlease donate to this channel through PayPal. More than $50 at once or $10 per month will get you ten hours of AUDIO extras from the Anadromist. Click this...    \nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GE5NHN8AYL3YC\n................\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas:  https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \n\nVisit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts.   \nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \n\nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia \n(Look it up on a map!) \nSwimming Against the Stream\nByrne\n\n#PaulVanderKlay #Christianity #DutchReformedChurch",
