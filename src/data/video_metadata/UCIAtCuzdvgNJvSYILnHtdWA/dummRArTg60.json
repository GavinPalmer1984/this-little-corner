 "date": "2019-07-26",
 "description": "This is the first in a series of discussions on the importance of time in our lives. Of living in time, not against it. It includes thoughts on the value of memory as well. This is a spiritual investigation, though it has many implications for science, philosophy and psychology. And it has even more implications for how we live our daily lives. But this is certainly no self-help polemic. I consider this to be the one thing I have done that might have some actual weight to it. \n\nPlease consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me financially here in Georgia.

Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne",
