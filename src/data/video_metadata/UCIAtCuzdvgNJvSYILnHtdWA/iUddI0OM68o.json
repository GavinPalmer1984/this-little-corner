Gian has been involved with L'Abri since 1955 and was one of the very first students to visit the center. He married the Schaeffer's oldest daughter Priscilla. The interview follows his history at L'Abri with Francis Schaeffer and discusses his approach to studying the Bible. For those interested in the history of L'Abri, this will provide additional insights. Gian's ideas were not always approved by L'Abri, yet it is our opinion that his contribution to the work was invaluable. And L'Abri's influence on Christianity was without a doubt crucial to the 2nd half of the 20th century and beyond. \n\nThe following names are mentioned in passing: Udo = Udo Middelmann, Ranald = Ranald Macaulay, Franky = Frank Schaeffer, Jim = Jim Ingram & Greg = Greg Laughery. The interview was conducted by Byrne Power. A second interview was also made at this time dealing with the specifics of Sandri's methods of interpreting the text. Any questions about this interview can be addressed here to Byrne Power. \n\n(This is the same interview that's on my Anadromous Life site. But I felt it really belonged over here where more folk can be exposed to Gian Sandri's ideas.Plus the sound quality has been improved.)\n\nTo read more about Swiss L'Abri:\nhttp://www.labri.org/swiss/\n\nI can really use the financial support here in Tbilisi Georgia. If you wish to help contribute here through PayPal. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\nIf you give $10 a month or more than $50 in one shot you will receive lots of extra content.\n\nMeanwhile to find my essay site go here:\nttps://theanadromist.wordpress.com\n\nThanks for listening and for thinking about these things. \nByrne\n\n\u00a92018 Byrne
