The questions were too good. So I had to split it in two. In this one I mostly cover the topics connected to art, music, and even a discussion about director David Lynch. And also we detoured into Hans Rookmaaker territory again. We'll do this again in March. Thanks for asking and listening to this. \n\n\n\nHans Rookmaaker What Is Reality?\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/store/Reality%20-%20Hans%20Rookmaaker.mp3\n\n\n\u00a0Mediated / Unmediated Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj76WwkerTQ\n\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.
