This is when the Internet suddenly caught on globally. This when when culture ceased being about adulthood and maturity ceased being a public value. This is when Teens and Tweens suddenly defined the culture, all the while not realizing that their desires we're being manufactured for them. Being cool and listening to rock music was no longer a sign of rebellion but an aspect of containment. This when Oklahoma blew up, video games and anime came to predominate, people were hysterical about the Y2K glitch and Columbine High School became a symbol of a greater youth disruption. Names like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Noam Chomsky, Marilyn Manson, Eminem, the Insane Clown Posse defined the times. We were rushing towards the end of the millennium with abandon and glee all the while expecting Armageddon. (Not knowing that what we expected had to wait 20 years to get here.) \n\nIt was the Time of Your Life. Oh wait that was actually a song by Green Day called Good Riddance filled with dismissive lyrics that teachers somehow thought would make great graduation slideshow music. Ah the Late Nineties...\n\nSince this is another long chapter in our historical saga here are some timestamps for the different sections. You can take as much or little as you want when you want it.\n\n02:30 The Pattern In Modern Arts\n15:45 The End Of Rock As Rebellion\n24:20 Music For Teens & Tweens\n53:30 A New Vision Of Youth\n01:10:20 Welcome To The Internet\n01:25:25 Technological Entertainments\n01:30:40 Raving Electronica\n01:56:00 Fin De Si\u00e9cle\n02:36:00 Coda\n\n''''''''\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY!
