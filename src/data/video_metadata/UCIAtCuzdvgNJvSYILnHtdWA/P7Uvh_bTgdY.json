 "description": "Here is the second part of the Q & A for February 2020. The questions were excellent. So I had to split it in two. In this one I spend a while discussing the possibility of community in a highly mediated age. Also I discuss the possible reality of angels and demons. We'll do this again in March. Thanks for asking and listening to this. \n\nPart one  of the February Q & A is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaDBhnVfz0I Mediated / Unmediated Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj76WwkerTQ\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.

If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) Byrne\n\n#community #media #demons #jesuspeople",
