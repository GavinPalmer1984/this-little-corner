 "description": "Well things are happening! The good and the bad. I need to tell the contributing subscribers a few important details. So listen today. But that's not all! There are interesting new videos over on Gravity From Above and Georgian Crossroads to check out. Also in the near future How We Got Here #11. AND coming down the road a new series called Tourism and Reality... Give us a listen today...\n................\n\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \n\nVisit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \n\nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. \nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \n\nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nSwimming Against the Stream\n\nByrne",
