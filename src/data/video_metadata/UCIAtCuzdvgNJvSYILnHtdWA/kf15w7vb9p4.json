 "description": "This is an updated and revised version of a lecture on the possibilities of puppetry in the 21st Century. It follows my own discovery of puppetry and my trips to Europe to understand the art. This lecture was popular on my other channel, The Anadromous Life. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLizS14Kip2qy-_b5AJk18g\nThis version includes the Q & A and a 2019 update on my involvement with puppetry and the state of the Gravity From Above documentary. This is a chance for the folks visiting this channel to understand - Why Puppetry? \n\nThis lecture with slides was originally given at the L'Abri Fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz, Switzerland, November 7th 2012. The presentation is both a general look at European puppet history and a personal journey into European puppet theatres. \n\nFeatured in this discussion are Jan \u0160vankmajer, The Brothers Quay, Ladislas Starevitch, Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka, Richard Teschner, Fran\u00e7ois Lazaro, the Salzburg Marionette Theater, Aurelia Ivan, Julia Kovacs, Buchty a loutky (Cakes and Puppets), DRAK, Teatr Groteska, the Figuren Zirkel, Henryk Jurkowski, Guignol, Punch, Ka\u0161p\u00e1rek, ESNAM (l'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts de la Marionnette), Die Schaubude, Polish puppetry, French puppetry, Austrian puppetry and Czech puppetry. As well as a discussion of my own puppetry in Haines Alaska. \n\nFor more information on the Gravity From Above documentary film project or about European puppets in general please go to:\nhttp://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com\n\nPlease contribute to my work through PayPal:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\n#puppetry #JanSvankmajer #ByrnePower #puppethistory",
