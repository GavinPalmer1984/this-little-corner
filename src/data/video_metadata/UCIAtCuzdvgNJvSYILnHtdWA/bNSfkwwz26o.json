 "description": "Netflix is halfway through a four season German television series named Dark. What started as a murder mystery has muted into a time traveling interrogation of the nature of such tiny subjects as God and Time. Such subject matter would normally, in American series, be relegated to sentimentality, simple mindedness or irony. Such a show might be considered pretentious by the cynical. But this show delivers the goods. \n\nAnd as such easily makes a handy Addendum to my Time series. So dig in my friends. And while you're at it watch the series. \n\n\nMy Time series begins here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dummRArTg60&list=PLJ895CQuvzeWUQEEg73MujIU86z7E7_Re\n\nYOU CAN SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.
