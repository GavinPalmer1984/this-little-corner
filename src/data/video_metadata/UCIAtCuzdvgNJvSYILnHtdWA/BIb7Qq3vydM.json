 "description": "The L'Abri Fellowship up in the Vaudois Alps of Switzerland occupies a curiously important place in history. But L'Abri's importance is not relegated to the past. Its lesson are even more vital for this highly abstract virtual age. From human conversation to setting flowers on the table the example of L'Abri can be a guide for us living in the unprecedented strangeness of the times. Francis and Edith Schaeffer started L'Abri back in 1955. Its heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s. Many people forgot about it after the death of the Schaeffers, yet it continues to be a beacon. Let's explore why?\n...............\n\nHere's the PayPal link in case you want to help out ....\nClick this...    https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GE5NHN8AYL3YC\n................\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas:  https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ Visit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \n\nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts.   https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \n\nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'.
