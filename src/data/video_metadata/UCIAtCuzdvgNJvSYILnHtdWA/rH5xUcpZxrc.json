 "description": "So I've been asked what books I would recommend, books that influenced me. And so I decided to go ahead and give it a whirl. I have read many more books than this. In fact I've read more books by CS Lewis than this entire list. And obviously this not meant to be definitive. But for me these were essential books in my own outlook. I don't expect anyone else to read all of these. But maybe one or two will spark your personal interest. But everyone watching this video should listen to Hans Rookmaaker's What Is Reality? lecture. This is part 1 of 2.\n\nLink to Rookmaaker's What Is Reality?\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/store/Reality%20-%20Hans%20Rookmaaker.mp3\n\nAnd this page on the L'Abri Ideas Library contains Rookmaaker's series of questions of Art and Culture (and so much more)\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/lecture-list.asp?s=1&page=3\n\nHere's my new YouTube channel, GEORGIAN CROSSROADS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nHere's my personal update on my life in Georgia circa autumn 2019. \nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/2019/10/11/the-joke-and-the-joker/\n\nPlease consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me from financially crashing here in Georgia. And if you start today you can get 7 hours worth of extra content immediately. \nClick this...  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nWatch this video for more about our extra content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykTp3TziRY\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne\n\n#inklings #cslewis #owenbarfield #books #tseliot",
