And so I decided to give a How To on handling the fire hose strength stream of disinformation that's been flowing from the mainstream media. And so I spend more than two and a half hours discussing the context of one thirty second clip from Portland, Oregon. My point here is less political than it is practical. No one is innocent of making Propaganda in my eyes. And the worst culprits are seen in the mirrors of those who just have to pass on the latest articles, memes, and screeds. My point: Don't contribute to the unraveling of everything. Remember the humanity of everyone, even those you've been taunted into believing are your enemies. \n.....\nHEY!
