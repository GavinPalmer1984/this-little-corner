So here is an attempt at relating some of the authors I am indebted to. I have read many more books than this. In fact I've read more books by Jacques Ellul than this entire list. So obviously this not meant to be definitive. But for me these were essential books in my own outlook. I don't expect anyone else to read all of these. But maybe one or two will spark your personal interest. But everyone watching this video should listen to Hans Rookmaaker's What Is Reality? lecture. This is part 2 of 2.\n\nLink to Rookmaaker's What Is Reality?\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/store/Reality%20-%20Hans%20Rookmaaker.mp3\n\nAnd this page on the L'Abri Ideas Library contains Rookmaaker's series of questions of Art and Culture (and so much more)\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/lecture-list.asp?s=1&page=3\n\nHere's my new YouTube channel, GEORGIAN CROSSROADS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nHere's my personal update on my life in Georgia circa autumn 2019. \nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/2019/10/11/the-joke-and-the-joker/\n\nPlease consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me from financially crashing here in Georgia.
