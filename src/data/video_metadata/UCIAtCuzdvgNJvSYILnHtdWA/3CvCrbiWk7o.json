 "description": "This is the fourth in a series of discussions on the importance of Time in our lives. We've already pointed out that Time is not the Clock. Yet there is a relationship between the two. We survey clocks in history in this episode. And discuss Calendar Time, Bell Time and Clock Time. And finally we look at the effect of convenience culture of how we live in Time.\n\n(By the way the opening moments of video are from Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublov)\nHans Roomaaker's What Is Reality? lecture can be heard here. \nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/lecture-list.asp?s=1\n\nPlease consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me from financially crashing here in Georgia.

If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne",
