 "description": "Here is the Q & A for December 2019. Excellent questions all round. I attempt to give some answers. Some topics were much too large, nevertheless I gave it 'the old college try' (whatever that means). I also spend a while with one of my signature ideas the Folk Matrix Pyramid, Which doesn't mean I'm talking about folk music much. Rather it has to do with the connection of art traditionally to daily life. We'll do this again in January. Thanks for asking and listening to this. \n\nMediated / Unmediated Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj76WwkerTQ\nTexture Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNKcU_4LP8\nNoise Enters Music Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KksRBCx5j6w\n\n\nYOU CAN SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.
