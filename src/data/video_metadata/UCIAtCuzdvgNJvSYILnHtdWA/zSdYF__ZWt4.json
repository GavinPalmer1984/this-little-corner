In answering these questions Rookmaaker inadvertently sets out an excellent course of how to approach art in a common sense way. He avoids the clich\u00e9s of the art cult. And focuses instead on the practical yet extremely deep issues surrounding the creation of art and how a person without any training can begin to approach art. This is the first of a set.\n\nNOTE: ROOKMAAKER'S COMPLETE WORKS ARE BACK IN PRINT. (See below.)\n\nWho was Hans Rookmaaker? \nHans Rookmaaker (1922 - 1977)  Dutch Art Historian - Born in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) in 1922. He was converted to Dutch Reformed Protestant Christianity in World War II while a prisoner of war in the Ukraine, where he met the Calvinist philosopher Johan Mekkes. After the war Rookmaaker noticed the lack of engagement in the arts by Christians in the West. In 1948 he met Francis Schaeffer, who would go on to form L'Abri in the little village of Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland. Schaeffer turned out to be someone with a similar outlook to his own. Later Rookmaaker along with his wife Anky would help to start Dutch L'Abri in the Netherlands at Eck-en-Wiel. \n\nHe often spoke in colleges, universities, seminaries about art and other related subjects. He was a mortal enemy of the kind of Christian propaganda disguised as art. Being Dutch he tended to speak exactly what was on his mind. And wherever he went he tended to stir up both deep thought and hot controversy. But by all accounts, and the evidence of his primitively taped lectures, he was an unforgettable presence. \n\nThis lecture is summation of his deepest ideas about how academia can recover a sense of meaning. It was given in 1976 and is a product of his last period before his early death in March of 1977.\n\nThe text of this lecture can be found in The Complete Works of Hans Rookmaaker, edited by his daughter Marleen Hengelaar-Rookmaaker.
