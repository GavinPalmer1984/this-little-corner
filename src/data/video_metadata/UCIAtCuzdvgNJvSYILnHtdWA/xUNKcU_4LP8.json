And why on earth does texture matter? And why should you care?\n\nThe full title of this lecture is Preliminary Notes On The Meaning Of Texture. It was given on October 24th 2018 at the L'Abri fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland. It's a preliminary study because according to my research almost no one has thought about this subject in any serious way. And yet it seems crucial to both understanding the times and surviving them. This is an introduction to the subject. Hopefully more people will add to these ideas. This is also a key in my studies in puppetry. But goes far beyond that art as well. \n\nMentioned in this lecture: Jan Svankmajer, Bauhaus, Art Nouveau, Modern Architecture and Design, Walter Gropius, Stanley Kubrick, New York City, Mona Lisa and Genie the Feral Girl.\n\nThis is the first of several lectures I have given i the past that I will post here. I am trying to clean up the sound and add a few visuals. Ultimately this is more about listening than watching. \n...............................................................................................................\n\nOh! And here is my companion essay at The Anadromous Life. https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/announcing-the-anadromist/\nI could really use some support out here beyond the walls in Tbilisi Georgia. Maybe consider some small monthly contribution through PayPal. Use this PayPal link to help out. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \nThanks for watching, more coming soon! Meanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!)
