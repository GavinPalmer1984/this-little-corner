 "description": "Here's the PayPal link in case you want to help out ....\nClick this...    https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GE5NHN8AYL3YC\n\nThe GoFundMe link is still active. Here's the link!\nGoFundMe link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/send-byrne-powers-library-from-alaska-to-georgia?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&utm_medium=os&utm_source=customer\n.....\nHere's the whole explanation of the task from May of this year.\n...\nGreetings from Tbilisi, those of you following me here in Tbilisi will know that I came all the way from Alaska to the Caucasus Mountains with certain expectations. The French money I thought I would be receiving didn't materialize and the job I had waiting for me here in Georgia was not what I expected it to be. Though fortunately I did get a residence visa card out of it.\n\nBut essentially I crash-landed in this wonderful country.To survive I did two things:\nOne, I applied for my Social Security Retirement money early. Two, I realized I needed a long term source of supplementary funds so I started a couple YouTube channels. (The Anadromist and Georgian Crossroads - links below) These ended up not only by providing for me and also making my life here in Tbilisi rather enjoyable and meaningful. But there is one thing that they have not allowed me to do...\n\nBack in Alaska, those of you who knew me there can attest that, I had a rather large library or books, music and films. I then had to leave my 21 year home in Haines Alaska. And in a frenzy of packing and moving I emptied my house putting everything into a storage unit. I had hoped to be able to afford to go back to Alaska put it into a container and ship it across the world to Tbilisi Georgia. Alas I haven't been able to do that yet.\n\nMy current storage contract ends in October. And at that point I will have to pay for another year. I could actually save up most of the funds by October this year but this would pretty much deplete my resources AND there is one big thing that stands in the way. I don't have a place to bring my library to. I am living in an apartment now that meets my needs, but there are several reasons why this won't make a good permanent home. So I need to buy a place.\n\nThe good news is that housing prices in Tbilisi range from extremely affordable to midrange inexpensive. I can actually find a three bedroom house for $40,000 and pay it off in 6 years.\nThis won't be in the neighborhood I'd like to be in. The more I can raise the closer I can get to where I'd like to be. But I'll certainly be satisfied with whatever I find. So what I need to do is raise enough for a very modest down payment, buy a house, and then make the journey back to Alaska, load everything into a container ship it here. And set my life back up.\n\nDoes this sound a bit crazy? It certainly is a herculean task that I can't do alone. I'm hoping that I've built up a reservoir of goodwill with you my friends in Alaska, New York City, California, in Europe, in puppetry, on YouTube, I'm asking you to help me get it it done. Otherwise quite frankly it'll be many more years before I can get it done on my own. \n\nSo I'm asking you to consider helping me conclude one of the more extraordinary chapters of my life. And I appreciate all of the help I already know is out there. So come along with me. I'm inviting you to take part in this adventure with me.\n\n................\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas:  https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ Visit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \n\nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts.   https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \n\nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nSwimming Against the Stream\n\nByrne\n\n#georgia #tbilisi #realestate",
