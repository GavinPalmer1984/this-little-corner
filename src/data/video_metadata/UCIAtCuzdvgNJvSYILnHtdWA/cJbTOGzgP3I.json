 "description": "This was a lecture given at Swiss L'Abri in Hu\u00e9moz February 16th 2016. The title, \"Horizontal Propaganda And Social Media\", is meant to be slightly puzzling, not cuddly, not friendly. The lecture is the same way. I hoped to hit as many forms of Propaganda as I could while indicting the systems we use as being far too easy to abuse in human communication. Were I giving the same lecture today I would really have to make a second part just to discuss developments since 2016. \n\nJacques Ellul's concepts on Propaganda are referenced quite deeply in the first part of the lecture. This is also the lecture that inspired me to write my 21st Century Propaganda series at the Anadromous Life essay site. \nWhich starts here...\nhttps://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/21st-century-propaganda-1/\n\nThis lecture has been hanging out over at The Anadromous Life site where it picked up a 400 views. But I feel that this one belongs over here. So it's moved (minus its old statistics). I think you folks will get it more. So watch it again a couple more times to help its stats get back to normal. ( I apologize for a slight error in the aspect ratio, but it seems good enough to leave alone.)\n\nMeanwhile I could gratefully really use support out here in Georgia. Finances are odd. Use PayPal if you want to help out. Madloba. (That's thanks in Georgian.)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne\n\n\n#JacquesEllul #propaganda #socialmedia",
