This time he discusses n*dity in art and the Christian reaction to it. This is the first of a set.\nBy the way YouTube censored this cover four times, I finally had to change it... And this is quite funny when you hear Rookmaaker discussing Jan Van Eyck's Adam and Eve.\n\nNOTE: ROOKMAAKER'S COMPLETE WORKS ARE BACK IN PRINT. (See below.) Go to Amazon US or UK.\n\nWho was Hans Rookmaaker? \nHans Rookmaaker (1922 - 1977)  Dutch Art Historian - Born in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) in 1922. He was converted to Dutch Reformed Protestant Christianity in World War II while a prisoner of war in the Ukraine, where he met the Calvinist philosopher Johan Mekkes. After the war Rookmaaker noticed the lack of engagement in the arts by Christians in the West. In 1948 he met Francis Schaeffer, who would go on to form L'Abri in the little village of Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland. Schaeffer turned out to be someone with a similar outlook to his own. Later Rookmaaker along with his wife Anky would help to start Dutch L'Abri in the Netherlands at Eck-en-Wiel. \n\nHe often spoke in colleges, universities, seminaries about art and other related subjects. He was a mortal enemy of the kind of Christian propaganda disguised as art. Being Dutch he tended to speak exactly what was on his mind. And wherever he went he tended to stir up both deep thought and hot controversy. But by all accounts, and the evidence of his primitively taped lectures, he was an unforgettable presence. \n\nThis lecture is summation of his deepest ideas about how academia can recover a sense of meaning. It was given in 1976 and is a product of his last period before his early death in March of 1977.\n\nThe text of this lecture can be found in The Complete Works of Hans Rookmaaker, edited by his daughter Marleen Hengelaar-Rookmaaker. THIS HAS JUST BEEN REPRINTED IN INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES. (Roughly $35 each or \u00a325.) BUY THEM NOW THEY WILL NOT LAST.\nHere is a Link to the US Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=hans+Rookmaaker+complete+works&i=stripbooks&ref=nb_sb_noss\n\n\nAnd here is one to the UK Amazon: \nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/s?i=stripbooks&k=hans%20Rookmaaker%20complete%20works&ref=glow_cls&refresh=1\nAnd more of Rookmaaker's L'Abri lectures can be found at the L'Abri Ideas Library.  https://www.labriideaslibrary.org\n\nSpecial thanks to Marleen Hengelaar-Rookmaaker for permission to use her father's lectures and for passing on the very few photos and one film of his that survive. \n.....\nSince I can't get monetized I need your help.
