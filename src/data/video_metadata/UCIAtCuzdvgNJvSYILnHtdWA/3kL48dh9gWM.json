Someone suggested that I go into a bit more depth on folks like Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Owen Barfield and more. So I also mentioned C.S. Lewis, Hans Rookmaaker, Joseph Campbell, Solzhenitsyn, Dostoevsky and Michael Polanyi.  I hope my ideas are clear enough to convey what I was trying to say. I am certainly not finished with the idea of Symbolism. But everyone watching this video should listen to Hans Rookmaaker's What Is Reality? lecture. \n\nLink to Rookmaaker's What Is Reality?\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/store/Reality%20-%20Hans%20Rookmaaker.mp3\n\nAnd this page on the L'Abri Ideas Library contains Rookmaaker's series of questions of Art and Culture (and so much more)\n\nhttp://www.labri-ideas-library.org/lecture-list.asp?s=1&page=3\n\n\nHEY!
