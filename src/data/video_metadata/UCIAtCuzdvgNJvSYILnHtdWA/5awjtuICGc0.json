 "description": "Here is the June 2020 Q & A for the Annus Horribilis 2020. Many interesting questions ranging from art to music to faith. But the real issue here is obviously the turmoil of the last few months. There was a sense of anxiety in the questions that wasn't present last time I did it earlier this year. I tried to do justice to the questions. I'm sure I left a lot unsaid. But then again I spent an hour and a half talking. So SOMETHING must have been said. Give a listen.
