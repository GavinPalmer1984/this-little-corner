 "description": "Where we are now? And what will the current crisis of 2020 mean to the future? We explore this question in episode #13 of How We Got Here. (Which is also the first Where We Are.) The Teens of the 21st Century were a crazy era. Political polarity was spread through new forms of media producing new forms of stupidity and hysteria.And then from a fairly unregarded province of China came whispers of a strange virus. And by April of 2020 much of the world was under lockdowns and quarantines in the first truly instantaneous global event in history. The questions began to form... what will the world be like after this moment in history? Give ear to our story. Maybe you will learn something.\n\nPLEASE CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CHANNEL THROUGH PAYPAL to get extra content and help us out. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nWatch this video for more about our extra content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykTp3TziRY\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n\n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'.
