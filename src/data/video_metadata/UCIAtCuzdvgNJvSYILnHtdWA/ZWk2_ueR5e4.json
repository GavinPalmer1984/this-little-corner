 "description": "Let's journey behind the mirror of 80's nostalgia. How We Got Here #6: The Illusions of the 1980's. In this episode we cover MTV, the rise of blockbuster films and blockbuster Broadway theatre spectacles. We look at postmodern culture in architecture, art, and music. And most importantly we cover the big event of the decade, the end of the Cold War. And then we ask why most Americans yawned over that momentous fact. \n\nSince this is another long chapter in our historical saga here are some timestamps for the different sections. You can bite off as much or little as you want. \n\n00:25 Introduction to the 1980's\n16:50 Postmodern Culture (Not Postmodern Philosophy)\n35:50 MTV and 1980's Pop Music\n01:11:10 Genre Movies and Blockbuster Films\n01:28:05 Blockbuster Theatre Productions on Broadway\n01:36:20 The End Of The Cold War\n02:25:20 Conclusions about our hall of mirrors called the 1980's\n\n''''''''\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY!
