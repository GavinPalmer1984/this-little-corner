And what are the possibilities of what we can know? Sometimes when you look around it seems that there are thousands of ways of looking at the universe and how we live within it. And yet the closer you look the more it becomes apparent that these beliefs essentially circle around three of four basic elements.

And I invite you to listen, stretch your own thinking a little, and tell me if you agree or have other ideas. \n\n\n\nHEY! SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL.
