 "description": "This is the first in a series of discussions called Anadromous Dialogues. This time I'm with Julian Waldner from a Hutterite Community in Manitoba, Canada. We talked about many things, including various Christian traditions. We contrasted the renewed interest in Orthodoxy with the radical Reformation. Alas I talked far more than Julian, we'll rectify that next time we talk with him. Julian has been featured several times on Paul VanderKlay's channel. To find out more about him check out his interviews there. \n.......\n.......\nSince I can't get monetized I need your help.
