 "description": "Welcome to 2020! As some of you may be aware The Anadromist is one of several channels and sites that I maintain for ideas and journeys. In this video I put my various ventures together to give you some idea of what I'm actually up to. I let you in on my new Georgian Crossroads channel. I give you an update on my Gravity From Above project. I give you some ideas of the topics that I'll be covering over at The Anadromist channel and much more. If you are a subscriber or a just visiting this channel this might open up a few interesting doors for you. And some of you may simply be wondering who I am. Well wonder no more. \n\n\n\nYOU CAN SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL. Please consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me from financially crashing here in Georgia. And if you start today you can get 7 hours worth of extra content immediately. \nClick this...  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nWatch this video for more about our extra content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykTp3TziRY\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne\n\n#music  #history #georgia",
