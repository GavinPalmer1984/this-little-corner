 "description": "Welcome to The Anadromist. \n\nThis is an invitation to swim against the stream of contemporary life with its addiction to screens, and its political hysteria and mockery. This is the ideas channel for The Anadromous Life. We already have another channel for documents called Gravity From Above. Visit it here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero\n\nAnd our main site for essays which is chock full of provocative content for you. \nhttps://theanadromist.wordpress.com/\n\nNot to forget our historical and philosophical work on puppetry and other arts at Gravity From Above.\nhttps://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/\n\nAnd if you wish to communicate do it over on the Facebook page for The Anadromous Life\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/\n\nAnd finally we aren't using Patreon or any other system at the moment, but we could sure use your help at PayPal. Use this link. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=i-dCAtFwsmNfdxpJriQal8D6Q5cqi7kXADfqJBvNWXB0EwH9_g8DXzbar75cTnavHqE_cW&country.x=US&locale.x=US\nAnd help me to continue producing The Anadromist.\n\nLet me know what you think over on The Anadromous Life Facebook page. Thanks. Byrne Power \nWELCOME!!!",
