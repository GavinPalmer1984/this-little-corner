 "description": "JOKER, the massively successful Todd Phillips film, is now a global game changer. This is a continuation of my look at how  the Joker became the King of the Dark Clowns. And NOW how clowns and especially Joaquin Phoenix's Joker have become symbols of protest and rebellion worldwide in less than a month. \n\nThis is a continuation of my video JOKER: KING OF THE DARK CLOWNS ...  https://youtu.be/-4rvQWhVvbA\n\nAnd it is a testament to the depth of Joker how much conversation it generates. I particularly appreciated Jonathan Pageau's take it. I have included links below to some of the best reviews I have run across so far. Joker essentially up ends the mainstream conversation of where we are and opens a door to a new cultural climate. Like Hitchcock's Psycho, which opened the door to a new darker cinema. And like Star Wars, which helped to create a new template for entertainment, the one Joker completely subverts. Joker is something that will have deep cultural resonances for years to come.\n\nSome worthy reviews:\nJonathan Pageau: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H74BbcTs6xs\nTim Pool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51GhgLuFBUk\nImpression Blend (Marianna Neal): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plcgVcbHEuQ\nChris Stuckmann: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyuxpky1Cw\nJeremy Jahns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJORkfmnmdY\nAkkad Daily (Carl Benjamin): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS9tHYYJgEE\nMasters of Movies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_fN3c66t74\n\nSUBSCRIBE!
