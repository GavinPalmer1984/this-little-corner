 "description": "This is the third in a series of discussions on the importance of Time in our lives. But what is Time? In this video we begin to consider some aspects of what time might be, and what it isn't. Time and the Clock are often confused. In this segment we try to disentangle them. \n\nPlease consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me from financially crashing here in Georgia.
