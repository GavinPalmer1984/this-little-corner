 "description": "If someone from 1962 were scooped up and dropped into the USA or the Anglosphere in 2018, I wager that they would not recognize the actions of their fellow humans. Among the many reasons for this would be the sense of emotional disorder that seems to pervade common discourse. \n\nThis isn't about politics. It's about sanity. And insanity.\n.....\nSince I can't get monetized I need your help.
