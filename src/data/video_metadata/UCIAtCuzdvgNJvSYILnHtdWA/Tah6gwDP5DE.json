 "description": "Another lecture from my 2017 visit to the L'Abri Fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland. I had run into a few students there in 2016 who seemed full of the utopian ideas of a perfect world. So upon my return in 2017 I thought I'd just go for broke and discuss the most difficult subject in American music history: Minstrel music. \n\nIt is my contention that we won't really understand American music until we can start to deal with this very long lived phenomenon. This was the most popular music in America for decades. It lasted almost 150 years. And it is one of the fountainheads of American music. Black and white completely mixed up. Both racism and flattery mixed together in one savory and unsavory stew. This is a glimpse into an utterly alien world long forgotten and now considered taboo to even envision.\n\nAnd yet without it there would be no ragtime, no barbershop quartets, no Broadway musicals, no jazz as we know it, certainly no country music, no bluegrass, no rockabilly, no rock music, no Chuck berry, no Michael Jackson, no Rolling Stones, no Eminem, no Elvis Presley. We'd still be dancing Scottish jigs and reels. (Not that that's such a bad thing.) The point is that this strange 'cultural appropriation' is the foundation of most forms of American music. That is a troubling thing. And that is a good thing. Life isn't neat and tidy. So enter the world of the Interlocutor and Be Seated! The show is about to begin. \n\n'''''''\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY! Please consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me afloat here in Georgia.
