 "description": "This is a slightly revised version of my lecture A Brief History Of Puppery.  This lecture was very popular on my other channel, The Anadromous Life. But I decided I also needed to put it here as well since it is a L'Abri Lecture.\nHere's the original version: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brief+history+of+puppetry\n (PLEASE NOTE: The other version is longer because it has two copyrighted pieces not in this version.) \n\nA few folks have commented that this is pretty long to be a 'brief history'. But to me this is barely an introduction to the history of puppetry. A real history would take 13 hours or more. This is a chance for the folks visiting this channel to understand - Why Puppetry? \n\nThis lecture with slides was originally given at the L'Abri Fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz, Switzerland, March 2nd 2016. \n\nFeatured in this discussion are Jan \u0160vankmajer, The Brothers Quay, Ladislas Starevitch, Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka, Richard Teschner, Bill Baird, the Salzburg Marionette Theater, Jim Henson, Buchty a loutky (Cakes and Puppets), DRAK, Henryk Jurkowski, Guignol, Punch, Ka\u0161p\u00e1rek, ESNAM (l'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts de la Marionnette), Asian puppetry, European puppetry, Japanese puppetry, Polish puppetry, French puppetry, Indonesian puppetry, Austrian puppetry American puppetry, and Czech puppetry. \n\nFor more information on the Gravity From Above documentary film project or about European puppets in general please go to:\nhttp://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com\n\nPlease contribute to my work through PayPal:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\n\nFor my on my adventures in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\n\n\n#puppetry #JanSvankmajer #Quaybrothers",
