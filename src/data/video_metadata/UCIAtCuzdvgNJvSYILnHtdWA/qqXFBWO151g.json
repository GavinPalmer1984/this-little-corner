 "date": "2019-08-25",
 "description": "This lecture, entitled Conceptual Humanity, is a discussion of the results of each persons following their desires or hearts, living their dreams, defining themselves. This lecture probes the limits of what people will do to show that they are unique, while at the same time revealing how similar are so many disparate trends. We explore rock and film stardom and fandom, body modification, questions of identity, and gender, doll imitation, doll relationships, robots. This lecture was given the L'Abri Fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz, Switzerland on February 24th 2016. \n\nSome of the topics and names mentioned: Hollywood movie stars Marilyn Monroe, Georgia Clooney, Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Pitt, Meg Ryan, Mary Pickford. Rock stars and image mutation, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Ani DiFranco, Miley Cyrus. We also discuss body modification, tattoos, piercing, gender transformation, Caitlyn Jenner, BIID, amputation. And we have an extended discussion on the new relationship between dolls and humanity, BJD dolls, life size fantasy dolls, and doll girls and guys, Barbie, Ken doll robots. We also examine futuristic notions of identity, the blending of the human and the machine and many other topics. \n\nHere is the original essay I wrote in 2012 that started me exploring some of this material: It's called A Doll's Heart\nhttps://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/a-dolls-heart/\n\nLinks to Material Referenced:\nLady Gaga - Born This Way:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw\nUncanny Lover N Y Times:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLVOnVsLXqw\nThe full version of Synthetic Pleasures documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muUklk8pTCE\nHow to watch the entire Whole documentary\nhttp://frozenfeetfilm.com/whole/\n......\nREMEMBER PayPal supporters over $50 dollars at once or as a recurring monthly payment of at least $10 can receive another 15 hours of other lectures too loaded with copyrighted content to put on YouTube in its current state.
