 "description": "Greetings! This is a full introduction to the channel and why I am launching it. I have another YouTube channel, The Anadromist Life, which has been running for several years and has had a very good response. It is mostly for documents: Puppetry in Europe, Georgian music and dance and other cultural phenomena, and a few lectures I've given. In the future I will be posting a few embellished versions of lectures here as well. But the point of this channel is to enter the dialogue of the times, something I have been preparing for my whole life it seems. Hopefully I have something worth listening too. (I'm sure you'll let me know.) And something to learn from you to can eventually engage in discussions directly. \n\nOh! And here is my companion essay to this introduction over at The Anadromous Life. https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/announcing-the-anadromist/\nI could really use some support out here beyond the walls in Tbilisi Georgia. The needs are there. Maybe consider some small monthly contribution. Use this PayPal link to help out. https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\n\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLizS14Kip2qy-_b5AJk18g\n\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/\n\nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other  arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/\n\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/\n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private with too many friends. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.)\n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! Meanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia\nByrne",
