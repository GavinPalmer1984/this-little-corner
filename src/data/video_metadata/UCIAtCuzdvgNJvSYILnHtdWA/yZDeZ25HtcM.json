 "description": "Let's go for the laugh this time. What's the dumbest question you've ever heard? Here are ten questions I heard with my own ears. \nAnd let's look at why people ask dumb questions. \n.....\nThe GoFundMe link is still active. Here's the link!\nGoFundMe link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/send-byrne-powers-library-from-alaska-to-georgia?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&utm_medium=os&utm_source=customer\n......\nPlease donate to this channel through PayPal. More than $50 at once or $10 per month will get you ten hours of AUDIO extras from the Anadromist. Click this...  \n  https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GE5NHN8AYL3YC\n......\nAnd I'm on Twitter now. There mostly to contact certain people. Feel free to find me there.https://twitter.com/anadromist\n................\nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas:  https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ Visit my Gravity From Above channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts.   https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd to understand more about my life in Georgia check out my Georgian Crossroads channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFJ6Tm71ieNcjcUb-Trc8g\nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! Meanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nSwimming Against the Stream\nByrne\n#stupidquestions #dumbquestions #travel",
