 "description": "Here is the next in my series of anadromous interviews with C.W. Weeks a self described Calvinist from Minneapolis Minnesota. C.W. found me through Twitter with interesting ideas to discuss, and it turns out he was also an eyewitness to the death of George Floyd. He can be found on Twitter at  https://twitter.com/cwweeks\n......\nKeep me afloat while traveling! Please donate to this channel through PayPal.
