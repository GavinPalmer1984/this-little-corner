 "description": "The Propaganda drone is endless these days. You want to just turn it off. But you are better off trying to understand the beast. Because in fact the OFF switch was broken sometime in the mid-20th Century. So my advice? Put your hands over your ears and you'll have peace for a day. Learn to see through the illusions and you'll find life again. \n\n\nThis time we watch a moment on the new Walking Dead spinoff called World Beyond, but would be better called seeking the youth market. And like so many teen focused dramas this one comes with heaping helpings of up to minute propaganda to make sure you know who to hate. Give it a watch. By my standards this is short one!\n\n'''''''\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY! Please consider a monthly contribution through PayPal to receive extra content and to help me afloat here in Georgia.
