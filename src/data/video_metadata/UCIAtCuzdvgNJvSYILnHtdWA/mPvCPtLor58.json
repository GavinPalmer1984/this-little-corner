This is a continuation of our last episode dealing with the aftermath of World War 2. In this survey we essentially see what we call the Sixties as a result of two traumas. The first and bigger one is World War 2. It's almost so big it can't be grasped. The Second is Kennedy's death. We are not here to theorize who did what, rather to state the massive changes that occurred after that sad event. \n\nYou can hear the complete 1956 Elvis interview here... complete with the line \"Somebody's decent kids\" Sections of this interview appeared on an Elvis - Introspective Interviews LP.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUCAYBE5CMU\n\nOh! And here is my companion essay at The Anadromous Life. https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/announcing-the-anadromist/\nI could really use some support out here beyond the walls in Tbilisi Georgia. Maybe consider some small monthly contribution through PayPal. Use this PayPal link to help out. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \nThanks for watching, more coming soon! Meanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) Byrne\n\nComing soon a lecture on Texture. (And who cares? You should.)\n\n(Oooh and look the Copyright police found me! I should have known it on the Elvis interview. Well I'm still a micro fry so I'm not worried about any revenue yet. Someday I should use all the musical examples and watch the copyright algorithms go insane trying to figure out who gets what.)", "duration": 3712, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "We're gonna devote our energies to sports and gardening all the cultural pursuits as far as they're concerned", "start": 0.31, "duration": 6.17}, {"text": "In fact, we're gonna put the goons to sleep", "start": 6.52, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "Meanwhile we dig", "start": 12.25, "duration": 2.659}, {"text": "We're world", "start": 23.22, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "Of readings welcome back", "start": 26.13, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "This is the anatomist power", "start": 30.03, "duration": 3.41}, {"text": "Back to continue discussing", "start": 35.46, "duration": 2.029}, {"text": "where we are in our", "start": 38.58, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "culture right now Western", "start": 40.59, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "what's left of Western civilization and", "start": 42.69, "duration": 2.689}, {"text": "How we got here?", "start": 45.9, "duration": 1.53}, {"text": "Last week I was discussing", "start": 47.43, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "World War two the biggest event in history", "start": 49.739, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "leaving approximately 70 million people dead and", "start": 53.85, "duration": 3.62}, {"text": "Also, I discussed the kind of the great silence after the war", "start": 59.07, "duration": 4.55}, {"text": "People just not wanting to talk about it either in Europe or Asia because they were exhausted or", "start": 65.7, "duration": 6.62}, {"text": "in America because", "start": 73.74, "duration": 2.45}, {"text": "But why would you want to talk about stuff like that?
