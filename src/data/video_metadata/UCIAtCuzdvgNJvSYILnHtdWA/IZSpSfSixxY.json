 "description": "Symbolism is the subject and this time we explore the great Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's seeming 'rejection' of the symbolic in his films. Yet when you watch his films you see levitating bodies, men with patches of white hair, rain drops in nearly every film, splotches of white  liquid in water and dogs among the many recurring motifs in his works. It all seems highly symbolic, and it is my contention, contrary to his own statements, that his films represent an even deeper layer of symbolism than we have have met previously. A personal symbolism. \n\nThere are layers of Symbolism. From the basic symbols we call number and letters to the allegories so prominent in oppressed societies and the deep level symbolism of shapes and images and finally the basic symbolic content of nearly everything. In this discussion I start to unravel a few of my own ideas of the realm of the symbolic. Let me know what you think. \n\nHEY! SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL TODAY.
