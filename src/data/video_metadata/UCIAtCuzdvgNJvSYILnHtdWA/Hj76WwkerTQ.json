 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj76WwkerTQ",
 "date": "2019-06-19",
 "description": "This is a lecture I was invited to give at the L'Abri Fellowship in Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland November 9th 2012. \"Mediated / Unmediated: Recovering Reality\" is a brief description of living in what Jacques Ellul calls the technological environment followed by many practical suggestions of how to loosen the effect of technology to give room for our humanity to breathe. I think anyone can benefit from engaging with this material. It's much more concrete that some of my usual subjects. \n\nThis is the one of several lectures I have given in the past that I will post here. I am trying to clean up the sound and add a few visuals. Ultimately this is more about listening than watching. \n...............................................................................................................\n\nOh! And here is my an essay I wrote in 2011at The Anadromous Life that deals with the same theme.. https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/salvaging-reality/\nI could really use some support out here beyond the walls in Tbilisi Georgia. Maybe consider some small monthly contribution through PayPal. Use this PayPal link to help out. \nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G9LDYMSPZ5RGG\nMy other YouTube channel is this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero \nThe Anadromous Life essay site for more in depth ideas: https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/ \nThe Gravity From Above site for more artistic ideas involving puppetry, music, dance and other arts. https://gravityfromabove.wordpress.com/ \nAnd if you want to communicate with me use The Anadromous Life Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/theanadromist/ \n(I don't want to have to make my personal page private because I have too many 'friends'. If it's dialogue you want go there. I'll start 'community' page soon enough if the demand is there.) \n\nThanks for watching, more coming soon! \n\nMeanwhile dig into the Anadromous past. Swim against the stream my friends. \n\nFrom Tbilisi Georgia (Look it up on a map!) \nByrne",
