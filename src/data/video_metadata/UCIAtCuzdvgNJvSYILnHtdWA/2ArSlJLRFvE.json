 "title": "Gian (John) Sandri 2016 Interview #2 - How To Approach The Biblical Texts",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ArSlJLRFvE",
 "date": "2019-09-26",
 "description": "How does one approach the Bible? What are the principles of good reading? \nHow does one make sense of the biblical texts in the 21st Century? \nThe following interview with Gian (John) Sandri was recorded in March 2016 in Hu\u00e9moz Switzerland in his home. Gian has been involved with L'Abri since 1955 and was one of the very first students to visit the center. He married the Schaeffer's oldest daughter Priscilla. This interview discusses the specifics of Sandri's methods of interpreting the biblical text. For those interested in the history of L'Abri, this will provide additional insights. Gian's ideas were not always approved by L'Abri, yet it is our opinion that his contribution to the work was invaluable. And L'Abri's influence on Christianity was without a doubt crucial to the 2nd half of the 20th century and beyond. \n\nI can really use the financial support here in Tbilisi Georgia.
