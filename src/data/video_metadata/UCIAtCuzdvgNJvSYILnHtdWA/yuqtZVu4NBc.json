But what is less commonly understood is the nature of the cult. This isn't Jonestown or Manson. These are Cargo Cults. This video, 21st Century Cargo Cults, is a study of the connection between our desires and our reality. That strange sense found in The Field Of Dreams, 'if you build it he will come'. Which is the perfect sentence encapsulating the idea of what a cargo cult is. We start with the original cargo cults in Melanesia and New Guinea. Then move into how Geekdom is nothing if not elaborated versions of cargo cults called Fandoms. We end up in this present moment of cargo cult politics. The idea that if we just say certain words over and over again we will receive the cargo, which is ultimately a spiritual concept, the nebulous idea of self invented identity. \n.....\nHEY!
