 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyCzdMYmaiA",
 "date": "2022-01-15",
 "description": "Julian, Jedidiah and myself all had some reservations about the direct of some parts of the recent conversation between Johnathan Pageau and Paul Vanderklay.  This is meant to open dialogue and not as a take down, as we all respect both men, and I at least genuinely love Paul.  We decided to talk about them.  There will be a part II because Jed dropped an LBGTQ bombshell that sidetracked us, but the conversation was important enough not to quash.",
