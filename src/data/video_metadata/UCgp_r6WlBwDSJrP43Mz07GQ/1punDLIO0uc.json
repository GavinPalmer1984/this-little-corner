 "description": "https://youtu.be/DLg2Q0daphE\n\nKaren and Mark continue to discuss the \"Psychedelic\" conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Vervaeke, covering the territory from 1:07:40 to about 1:40:00, all the way from mind as an embodied auto poetic dynamical system to Foucault's Pendulum.\n\nIn all of this, Jordan seems to be trying to determine how \"God\" interfaces with his consciousness, how all of this fits into his big claim regarding what some call the \"culture war\" (Mark objects to that terminology.)\n\nBoth JV and JBP agree that the atheistic critique of religion is at a propositional level. \n\nReligion is not about knowledge but about wisdom - about embodying it, establishing a relationship with it, worshipping it, taking it into your identity.\n\nThey use \"it\" perhaps because they are thinking of the process that brings order out of chaos. Karen posits that we shouldn't be talking about \"it\" but about the \"One\" who acts to bring order out of chaos.\n\nMuch discussion about worship, how to differentiate true worship from idol worship and addiction.\n\nCelebration v. entertainment. \n\nJohn's 4 P's restated focusing on the participatory. You don't just attend you don't just receive you participate, the top down and the bottom up.\n\nJBP \"Akin to the dance between revelation and criticism\" Is it revelation & dialogical evaluation that constitutes the participatory element of attention?\"  Here Karen quotes the intro from Dorothy Sayers' The Mind of the Maker, about the critique that is intended to bring the imaginal closer to the reality.\n\nPredictive processing - adjusting the map to the reality. The imagination is the map. We see the errors in the map. \"The errors are where the territory pushes its nose through.\" JBP in a discussion with Roger Scruton, \"We meet the transcendent when we err.\"\n\nJBP - selecting each other for the manifestation of the Logos.\n\nDiscussion about prediction v. anticipation, and JBP's switch from anticipation to desire.\n\nPersonality theory.\n\nJV - precision weighting because you can't privilege everything.\nJBP - Pageau would say the basis of worship is what directs attention. JV agrees. JBP - because \"The apex of attention has this drive towards unity and that's personality - these are religious claims.\"\n\nJV - We're too locked in to the sacred as perfection.\nJBP - Is the sacred the Good becoming Better?\nJV - It's an inexhaustibleness.\n\nSacred is when you keep going back to the well, there is always more.\nJV says Plato. JBP says the Bible. Jesus says the Living Water.\n\nMetatraits of stability/plasticity, efficiency/resiliency overlaid on the Big 5.\n\nJordan's paper from 2009 that John is using as a source w/o realizing it came from Jordan. \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19558442/\n\nJV: \"Personality is simultaneously helping to glue cognition together within the individual and glue cognition together in distributed cognition among individuals.\nJBP: \"That would explain the existence of the niches that personalities fill, because they are useful, valuable because they expand and stabilize the map.\"\n\nJBP: The issue of God hinges on the metaphysical significance of consciousness. Do you think that's right?\n\"Consciousness is not the fundamental mystery. Reality is the fundamental mystery, and the secondary mystery is the relationship between consciousness and Reality. Is it a primary relationship?\nWhere is that Reality without consciousness? What is out there without us? Forget us. What is out there without consciousness?\n\nJV brings up Speculative Realism (programming as a metaphor, Object Oriented Ontology). \"If you're going to be a realist, you have to admit into your metaphysics relationships between things that do not depend on us for their existence, on us being aware of those relationships. They have to be able to influence and disclose to each other in a way that is dark to us.\"\n\nJBP: \"It means that you can pick up the orbit of the earth on Foucault's pendulum - that the All is embedded in the singular, and you see that with Foucault's pendulum.\n\nNext time, we will start with the Affordances.\n\nA play list of all ten episodes analyzing this conversation: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoARw9zo4EUYEEhM_KIgzl_eW9ZZTHbzh",
