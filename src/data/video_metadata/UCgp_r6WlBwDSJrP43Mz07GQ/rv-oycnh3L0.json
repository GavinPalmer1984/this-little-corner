I come into conformity with the cup.\n\nJBP\nThat\u2019s what happens when you pick up the cup according to Piaget.\nMimicking the cup by trying to understand it.\n\nJV\nYou\u2019re shaping yourself to it which is different. The difference between Cartesian and theological.\nCartesian - I don\u2019t have to undergo transformation fundamentally in who I am in order to know, just properly organize my propositions. But unless I go through transformation, there are deep truths that will not disclose themselves to me.  \nPeople feel themselves being conformed to reality through the Logos.\n\nJBP - So that\u2019s a feeling of personal transformation? Same feeling of tracking - Same as stumbling uphill toward the city of God? \u2026\n\n28:31\nJV In the Socratic tradition, there\u2019s no clean separation from knowing the thing and knowing yourself.\n\nJBP Is there a clear separation in the insight experiences?\n\nJV When you start to link them together you can start to get flow experiences\n\nJBP And if you link them together too much, you get non-stop flow experiences and the question then is can you tolerate it?\nI\u2019m not sure I can tolerate it.\n\nJV\nHot flow - a lot of metabolic expenditure, but the flow state with tai chi tron, not the same sense that you\u2019re going to burn out.\n\nJBP\nI must be in a hot state of flow all the time\n\nJV\nThe thing about the good state of flow is that it opens up the possibility to have more time to explore that participatory sense.\nThat sense of at one ment\n\nJBP\nAtonement\n\nJV\nExactly\n\nJBP\nThat pulls original sin into it.\n\nJV\nOr the other way around - or original sin made use of at one ment\n\nJBP\nAs the antidote. As the stuff of the grail, atonemen. That\u2019s the city on the hill, too,\nOr the wandering up to the city on a hill.\n\nJV\nPilgrim\u2019s Progress and Augustine\u2019s City of god going thru my head.\nWhen you can get into a cool flow\u2026\n\nJBP Teach me.\n\nJV What we are talking about in these circling practices is shared flow\n\nJBP\nmy talk with Jonathan Pageau - it got a million and a half views - WTH\u2019s going on?\n\nJV\nJonathan is more radical Christian than he realizes.\n\nJBP\nYes, and I think that might be true of you, too, and quite possibly, it\u2019s also true of me.\nYou and your Logos, John.\n\nJV\nThat\u2019s funny cuz I\u2019ve had some Christians say that to me.\n\nJBP\nIt\u2019s not exactly a trivial compliment, John, old Daoist friend on the border between chaos and order\u2026\n\n33:15\nJV\nMaybe when people are seeing the spirit of Christ in me, I hope what they are referring to is something that\u2019s coming into my awareness with intelligibility, and that is being actualized in reality. I hope that I\u2019m realizing the Logos with other people.\n\nJBP\nYour effect on your students is evidence of that, John. What do you think of your name, John.\n\nJV\nJohn a gift from God\n\nJBP \nMy middle name is Berndt, it\u2019s Norwegian.\n\u2026.. my grandfather\u2026.\nI had an Indian carver build my third floor which you\u2019ll have to see sometime. He built a totem of me and I\u2019m standing in the arms of a bear. I didn\u2019t know that that was the meaning of my name. That really happened. Who knows what\u2019s in a name.\nJordan Berndt Peterson\n\nJV\nJohn was my favorite gospel.\n\nJBP\nYeah, that makes sense. In the beginning was the Word \n\nJVYeah the Logos\n\nJBP\nThat suits you.\n\nWhat do you make of this comment, that the Spirit of Christ is being manifest in you? \nIf you take that seriously, how do you maintain yourself?\n\nJV\nalso my girlfriend,  who is officially an atheist...\n\nJBP My biggest takeaway was from my Biblical series? The Meaning of Israel.\nWe who wrestle with God. We who struggle with God. Maybe that\u2019s the real Christian spirit, the Jewish spirit.The wrestling spirit. Why is there that strange scene where he wrestles with the angel? Isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re doing all the time?\n\nJV\nHe partially wins, though. That\u2019s what is so mysterious.\n\nJBP\nAnd hurts you doing so...But isn\u2019t that the story? Not belief, but wrestling with belief.\n\nSo that\u2019s the other metaphor for dialog...and that sums up men\u2019s relationships, tracking and sparring.\n\nJV\nPlato\u2019s nickname means wrestler.\n\nJBP\nSuits episode. The men are always sparring.\n\nJV\nYou can shift off of that like me and Bernardo Kastrup - off of victory to the flow state. The aesthetics of the dance, a beautyyou can appreciate for its own sake, independent of victory. Plato talks about the beauty, the eros, the dance that draws you beyond yourself.", "duration": 5126, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "mark and i are back again today to talk", "start": 2.8, "duration":
