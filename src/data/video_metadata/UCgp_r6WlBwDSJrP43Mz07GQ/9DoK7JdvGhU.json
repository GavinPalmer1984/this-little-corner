The difficult experiences of his childhood led to depression born of nihilism but out of that, he found a way to teach himself how to approach life with enthusiasm and discipline when he decided that the only thing that was worth doing was to try and understand what Being is.\nWhen his career in neuroscience didn't provide all the answers he was looking for, he then trained in psychoanalysis, so he looks at this issue both from a scientific view but also from that of a clinician with real world experience of people's stories.\nConsciousness arises out of feelings located in the brain stem, in the ancient, lowly brainstem.\nReticular Activating System arouses cortical function as a way of maintaining homeostasis. The biological mechanisms of life resist the2nd law of thermodynamics and minimize entropy.\n\nThe function of feelings is to deal with uncertainty. Cognition can go on in a completely unconscious way, but when a need arises (thirst, hunger, suffocation, etc) we must make choices. Feelings make a demand upon the mind for work and conscious cognition is the work that is demanded.\n\"What must I do to satisfy my needs?\"\nWe have a predictive model. \nMemories are about the past but for the future.\nIncreasing entropy increases the number of questions, increases the uncertainty when your decisions don't succeed.\nThe need to play. Piaget, Panksepp.\nSeeking, a foraging drive - engage with uncertainty, risk taking, play.\nSolms does not have a totally reductionistic, mechanistic view of the world.\nThe lived life of the mind, subjectivity, the importance of story.\nFreud:  \"My case studies read like short stories.\"\nNarrative medicine\nOliver Sacks endangered his career by exploring these things.\nIn response to a question about Barfield's theories of the evolution of consciousness, Solms brought up:\nDavid Lewis Williams, archaeologist, two books:\nThe Mind in theCave\nDeciphering Ancient Minds.\nThe ratio between the known and the unknown is like a single grain of sand on one beach among all the beaches on earth.\n\nTalk at The Royal Institution:  https://youtu.be/CmuYrnOVmfk\nSolms' Q & A:
