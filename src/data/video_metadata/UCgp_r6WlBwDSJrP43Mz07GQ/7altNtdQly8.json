 "description": "We look at the overlay between paradox and participation while discussing Owen Barfield in the context of the following:\nPolitics is downstream of culture.\nCulture is downstream of communication.\nCommunication is downstream of language and meaning.\n\nMeaning is the place we have to start if we are going to get the rest of it right.\n\nMale and Female, the union and the differences, are at the heart of reality.\nOur current disconnect between mind and body is a result of imaginative machinery which has lost its default setting.\n\nTimestamp\n0:00 Introduction\n1:55 Chloe Valdary on Paradox\n7:10 Participation\n15:34 Ben Hur and Scene Setting\n21:30 Trees and Our Imaginative Machinery\n23:39 Michael's Big Announcement!\n28:43 Michael's journey back to faith\n33:20 Male Female Dynamic at the Heart of all Reality\n\nThe poem that was read at Michael's wedding:\nIn Defeat\nDefeat may serve as well as victory\nTo shake the soul and let the glory out.\nWhen the great oak is straining in the wind,\nThe boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk\nSends down a deeper root on the windward side.\nOnly the soul that knows the mighty grief\nCan know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come\nTo stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.\n\u2014 Edwin Markham. \n\n\"Redemption joins the suffering, beauty and joy in the world.\"\nMichael Leighty\n\nChloe Valdary clip on paradox:\nhttps://youtu.be/0cBS9SPG_rM?t=3134\n\nMark Vernon and John Vervaeke:\nhttps://youtu.be/INz4dC7vVWQ\n\nOwen Barfield's Saving the Appearances (A Study in Idolatry)\nIain McGilchrist's The Master and His Emissary (The Divided Brain\n  and the Making of the Western World)",
