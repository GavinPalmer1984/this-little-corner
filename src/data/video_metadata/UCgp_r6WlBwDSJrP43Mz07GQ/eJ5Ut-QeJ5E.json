 "description": "What has happened to the sense of humility in science? Making a virtue of vice.\nPromoting self-esteem as the highest virtue and humility as an aberration.\nIs humility necessary??\nWhat are the major concerns?\n\nConsensus thinking became more of a thing when federal money started pouring into\nScience during the Manhattan Project. Grant applications are tedious, time consuming and uncertain, and tend to go towards specified directions, removing some of the freedom to choose a path of discovery.\nBig expenditures like the Hadron collider.\nFederal bureaucrats are the gatekeepers to the government\u2019s deep pockets.\n\nWe are discussing some ideas that were exposed in depth in The Portal podcast with Eric Weinstein interviewing Brett Weinstein (the DISC) and also his interview with Roger Penrose regarding spin theory and twistor theory.\n\nArticle by Ira on Humility:  https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/02/ira-katz/humility/\n\nThe Portal with Eric Weinstein\nWith Brett Weinstein, Episode 19\nWith Roger Penrose, Episode 20\nhttps://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL3RoZS1wb3J0YWw&ved=0CAAQ4aUDahcKEwiQ0cTBwqznAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ&hl=en\n\nSee also Nima Arkani Hamed\u2019s lecture at Cornell on the Morality of Fundamental Physics\nhttps://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-morality-fundamental-physics\n\nMuch funding is directed either towards 1) what is already working, incremental changes on a PHD thesis for example, rather than on new ideas or 2) what everyone wants to be working on because it\u2019s the \u201cin\u201d thing, string theory for example.  In both of these examples, it is possible to get deeper and deeper into very small channels, or become overly abstract.\n\nAs research goes, once it gets into the newspaper, you can be assured it is being way overblown and not taking the inherent limitations into account. Every good paper has a section on limitations, scoping the whole problem.\n\nHe sees string theory as divorced from reality, a theoretical idea as abstract as a mathematical construct. \n\nC. S. Lewis\u2019 Discarded Image\n\nStatements of fact differ from reality.\nAll that we know for sure is that all happens as if our description were true, not whether it actually explains reality.\n\nTheory should be seen only as a provisional understanding of the truth, knowing that we will understand it more fully in the future.\n\nHis experience with his brother taught him how the psychiatric profession fudges on the impact of certain pharmaceuticals. Whenever we are trying to quantify behavior, we must be humble and remember that we are dealing with human beings, in the messy middle.\n\nThe distinction between technology and Science where equations were used in engineering, cathedrals were built without equations.\n\nTechnological growth is very entrepreneurial and empirical in the past, but now it\u2019s mostly technocrats who have become incredibly wealthy moving to the top of the hierarchy and gaining influence.\n\nThere\u2019s a danger of over classifying.\n\nSome scientists see themselves as pure truth-seeking beings, but they are not, any more than are we. They think they are perfectly objective, but no one is. Even the choice of a subject to investigate is a very subjective act. \n\nThe distinctions between chaos, chaos theory and complexity theory.\n\nWatch out for any place that power becomes too concentrated, whether it is in government or in bureaucracy or in the hierarchies of science or technology. \n\nNext time, we plan to talk about the difference between in initial value problem and \nAn initial boundary value problem.\nInitial conditions, boundary conditions, fluid mechanics and the transition to turbulent flow.\nIn order to do so, there is an empirical statistical value that you reinsert.\n\nKaren\u2019s art website:  www.karenwongart.com\nKaren\u2019s blog:  www.TheMeaningCode.com",
