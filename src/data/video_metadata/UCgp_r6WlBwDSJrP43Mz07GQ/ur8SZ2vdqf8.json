 "description": "Owen Barfield, Saving the Appearances\nFiguration, Alpha thinking, Beta thinking\nMeaning and Data compression\nReligion is whatever has class to being of highest value\nThe hierarchy that enables action in biological creatures\nDominance provides unity which provides meaning\nTransjective is the union of the subjective and objective.\nYou are apprehending and at the same time, you are apprehended.\n\nThe Chosen by Chaim Potok, pain and suffering are a necessary part of the fabric of the world.\n\nThe hole in Like Stories of Old - Love is always self-sacrifice. Meaning on an individual scale is not meaning at all.\nThe feminine:  the mystery, the space, the question.\nWomen are selective maters so they drive the potential of the species.\nFeminine - more than can be said:\nThe Mystery\nThe Space\nThe question\n\nAs a believer, the importance of vulnerability is highlighted.\n\nThe stories are all nested, like Russion Dolls.\nThe largest story has the most power to delimit.\n\n\nBecoming Human, Reflections on Christian Anthropology\nD.
