 "description": "Jay is a Christian, a retired Electrical Engineer, Information Systems Designer, Business Founder and Owner, Photographic artist in training, a car and motorcycle enthusiast, interested in psychology, neuroscience and cooking. He loves the woods, he loves America, and he loves the Lord.\n\nWe talk about what causes the communication breakdown between two people of good will who are truly trying to find a way to understand and help each other to a better life?\n\nAlong the way, we talk our past histories, how an injection of chaos can beautify order, how today's cosmology affects our way of thinking.\nAre the constants really constant? Getting back to first principles.\nThe fears produced by our cognitive dissonance that keep us from peeking over the wall.\n\nHow do we establish a set of principles that would allow people of different frameworks to communicate to bring beauty out of chaos, to interact effectively with people of differing belief systems? \n\nWhat can be learned in the wind, the water and the wilderness?\nWhat kind of bridge can be built to connect Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris?\n\nAre there supplements that will improve our chances against Covid?\n\nDavid Berlinkski speaks at Socrates in the City\nhttps://youtu.be/0XIDykeZplU\n\nJim Keller on Lex Fridman\nhttps://youtu.be/Nb2tebYAaOA\n\nJohn Vervaeke and Paul VanderKlay\nhttps://youtu.be/1okG5kGSa6E\n\nDr. Schmidt supplements\nhttps://thenutritionalhealingcenter.com/about-us/our-practitioners/darren-schmidt-d-c/",
