S. Lewis paraphrase)\n\nHeidegger doesn't have a place for the transcendent. \n\nBarfield influenced by Coleridge - the noumenal and the phenomenal.\n\nWhat makes you curious?\n\"Words are like the DNA of human consciousness.\" (Barfield)\nForm and the expression of that form - consciousness is transmissible from one person to another. Words are like fossils of consciousness. There is so much meaning around a word that the word becomes a token for meaning folded up into each word. Words are keys that unlock certain parts of your brain.\n\nAspirational - telos - higher point.\nMake yourself as much as possible maximally responsible for what is wrong in the world. Balancing justice and mercy.\n\nWhen you go back in time with language, it becomes more and more metaphorical, putting things together instead of taking things apart.\n\nBeing is always saying. To ask about the origin of language is to ask about the origin of origin.\n\npre-Kant, the working of the mind was not separate from the cosmos.\nAt Kant, the noumenal and phenomenal divided.\n\nLanguage is given in a state that connects. Ex: pneuma means spirit, wind and breath. Ancient man was more spiritual.\n\nJohn McWhorter has a course on the History of Language in Great Courses.\n\nAs words become more particular, they lose their richness.\nMeaning is always about how things fit together. \n\nFor the infinite to manifest to the finite, there has to be some move.\n\nEarly German romantics, finite longing for the infinite.\n\nPoetry for Barfield is the mode of consciously being aware of the inexpressible nature of reality and yet trying to do it with words.\nIntensely subjective but uniting it with the objective, drafting an image of what is unrepresentable.\n\nThe world is a complex place. We are always hiding our weaknesses.\n\nYou can't be forgiven yourself if you are unwilling to forgive another.", "duration": 5269, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "good morning Michael hey how's it
