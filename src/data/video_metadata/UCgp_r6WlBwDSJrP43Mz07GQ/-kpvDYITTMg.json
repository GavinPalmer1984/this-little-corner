the almost psychedelic conversation: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoARw9zo4EUYEEhM_KIgzl_eW9ZZTHbzh\n\nWe discuss the 4 P's of knowing\nThe drive towards unity in the motivational hierarchy\nNeo-Platonism\nReligion is impossible, statistically speaking, and yet, here we are.\nPredicrtion is hubris.\nSample bias and Hindsight bias\nPlotinus - knowledge as a process of oneness\nThe body informs your limitations\nMark said, \"Knowledge gives me the ability to cohere to the intelligibility past mere information\", which I take to mean, knowledge helps me to align with Reality.\nInformation and Intelligibility\nPrincipalities and Power\nCritique rather than Deconstruction\nScientific truth and Religious truth\n\nWe will start next time with Heidegger, from the
