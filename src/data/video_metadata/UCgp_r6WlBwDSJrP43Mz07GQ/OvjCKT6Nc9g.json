 "description": "Karl and Ira join me to respond to Paul VanderKlay's video about Meditations on Moloch, a blogpost from Slatestarcodex. \nPaul's Video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfJ0yms0sOA&t=1910s\nWe discuss the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Fish Farm and \ntheoretical ideas v. empirical reality.\nForce is a natural consequence of utopian striving.\nGame Theory\nThe circle of trust differs according to societies.\nPrivate ownership an important preventative for the tragedy of the commons - \nThe Yellow Vests (Gilet Jaunes) in France may have some legitimate grievances. Take heed.\nCrony Capitalism - when the government picks winners and losers in the market rather than allowing the multitude of individuals to be the decision makers.\nA true free market requires a free flow of capital. In today's world, there is no longer a true market for capital.\nThe U. S. constitution is based on the idea that Government is instituted to secure our natural rights, not to give them to us.\nPaul VanderKlay's original video in which he talks about us and includes the material from Meditations on Moloch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfJ0yms0sOA&t=1910s\nKarl suggests that Paul read some Thomas Sowell (or watch any of Thomas Sowell's wonderful youtube interviews)\nDouglas Murray, The Strange Death of Europe, The Madness of Crowds",
