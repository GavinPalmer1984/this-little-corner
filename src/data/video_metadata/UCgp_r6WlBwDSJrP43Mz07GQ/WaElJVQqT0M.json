Agapic Love, Randos and A Grief Observed", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaElJVQqT0M", "date": "2019-09-14", "description": "A discussion of what the meaning crisis is, how it shows itself in various avenues of life and how it intersects with a loss of hope. A look at how hope arises out of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and how that changed the world. We looked at our own lives to determine some of the reasons for hopelessness, isolation, denial.\n\nWe pursued John Vervaeke's idea that agape love calls the object of love into being as a sculptor discovers his subject in the stone or as an artist finds the subject within the chaos on the canvas and how that relates to each of us in our personal journey through pain, chaos and the adventure of learning who we are and whose we are.\n\nMary and Shari bring joy to the conversation.\n\nReading with Randos: A Grief Observed by C. S. Lewis\nhttps://youtu.be/WrsJInvreWs\n\nShari with Jeff on\nReading with Randos: Spirits in Bondage by C. S. Lewis \nhttps://youtu.be/tNnOHUWL2pQ\n\nMary Kochan: Joseph Ratzinger enters the conversation\nhttps://youtu.be/OnpcOS2VvmI\n\nAt the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light\nand the burden of my soul rolled away,\nIt was there by faith I received my sight, \nand now I am happy all the day.
