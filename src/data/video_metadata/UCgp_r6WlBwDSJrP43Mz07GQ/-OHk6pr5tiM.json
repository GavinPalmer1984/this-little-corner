Something to do with the connection to the divine.\nBarfield translates phenomenon in the middle voice. Paul often talks of prayer in the middle voice.\nIcons suspend idolatry because we learn to see through them.\n\nWhat does Christianity have to offer? Humility, a vision of unknowing.\nYou can learn a lot about God by attending to reality.\nThe link to the imagination has something to do with moving us toward the \"final participation\" Barfield talks about.\nFree will v. God's sovereignty?  We do play a role, and also, God is sovereign\n\nColeridge\nImagination is reason in her most exalted mood.\nProse is the words in the best order. Poetry is the best words in the best order.\nThe concept of gift is fundamental to Christianity. \nNot \"MINE\" (like Gollum, a place of idolatry), but \"This is a gift from our gracious God.\"\nLearning to see things as gifts from the Creator rather than \"givens\".", "duration": 6813, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "all right so i'm here today with um", "start": 0.08, "duration":
