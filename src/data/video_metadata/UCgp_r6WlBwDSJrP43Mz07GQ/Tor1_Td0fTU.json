 "description": "Karen, Nate and Michael discuss #7 from the Radical Orthodoxy 7 Theses.\n\nFirst we define terms:\nCosmic relates to a reflection of the cosmic order. Also, it is a stipulation of scope and relates to a reconciliation of ALL things. \"The creation groans.\"\n\nCommunal relates to the mechanism by which salvation happens. Knowledge and transformation come through other people. Transmitted through time by these communal relationships.\n\nWhat it means to be a person is fundamentally a relationship. We are not yet persons, but are in the process of being turned into persons. To attribute personhood solely to will and intellect is an error of modernity.\n\nMilbank opposes the ideas of Duns Scotus because of the loss of participation. It is a move too much toward Aristotle and opposing Plato.\nIf you lose the notion of participation and relation, it leads inevitably to nihilism. Scotus spoke of univocal, which is to use a word in the same way every time. The Good in both these sentences is equal. He is a good God. He is a good man. This causes a loss of analogy. Relation is connected to analogy. A recognition of likeness.\nWithout reference to analogy and metaphor, we can't begin to know who we are.\n\nWhat is the nature of propositions? The propositional layer is a map. Idolatry is how we confuse the proposition for the thing itself, mistaking the map for the territory. \n\nThink of propositions in terms of marriage. Marriage is more of a commitment, and the trust or belief in the other grows over time. You grow to believe the propositions about the other's character as those propositions become real to you, become embodied, by experience and relationship.\n\nNate suggests that science is an attempt to abolish trust. Reduces everything to whether or not it is falsifiable.\n\nOur actions play some role in the cosmic redemption story. These things really matter. We must cultivate our garden. He works with us on this.\n\nThe book of Scripture.\nThe book of Nature.\nThe book of History.\n\nSocial markets and just exchange. Markets are a natural product of human interaction, a non-coercive sharing with equality of access to opportunity.\n\nNext time, we will doing a review of Radical Orthodoxy 1 through 7.",
