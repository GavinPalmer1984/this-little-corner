 "description": "Bil Harries, Chief Science Officer of Aromyx Corporation in Silicon Valley.\nGrew up in Western New York. Grandparents were gardeners and instilled a love of living things\nwhich led him towards his career of biology. \n\nUndergrad in biology, MS in Biology, doing research on immunohistochemistry of the eye and how cataracts form to find a way to prevent their formation.\nStudying the visual system, had the opportunity to delve into a world that no one ever sees.\nLooking at a protein that was at the time classified as MIP 26, thought to be a particular kind of protein called a gap junction, but later discovered to be a water channel.\nIt turns out that the protein in the lens of the eye is incredibly dry surface so that it has perfect clarity and that if water gets into the crystalline structure of the lens, it clouds up.\nGot a  PhD in cell biology and human anatomy and had a career in teaching, but continued to study how water gets in and out of cells. \nAfter 25 years, became a professor at a Jesuit University in San Francisco teaching genetics where he learned of the work of Bob Stroud, a structural biologist using x-ray crystallography to determine the underlying structure of the protein in order to determine its purpose. Joined him to do a post-doc at UCSF looking at the protein at a 2 angstrom resolution, another world no one ever gets to see.\nRetired from UCSF to join a group of scientists who were using the Nobel prize winning work of Buck and Axel on olfaction, which works very similarly to vision.\nThe startup seeks to produce a mechanism that can take a recording of the smell and digitize it to produce actionable data.  https://www.aromyx.com\n\nThe human olfaction system has 400 receptors and is capable of differentiating a trillion smells.\nDogs have 800 to 1200, Elephants over 2000. Dogs can be used to detect cancer.\nWorking with Johns Hopkins and MIT to determine whether their engineered biosensors can detect the biomarkers for cancer.\nAlso, ectopic olfactory sensors line the gut and probably set your whole metabolism, as we take sensory cues from our microbiome. Satiety is triggered by olfactory receptors.\n\nThe olfactory system is actually a communication system and may be one of the ways that the parts of the body know how to arrange themselves during gestation.\n\nHappy to have found a collaborative atmosphere in Silicon Valley with lots of cross-pollination and sharing of ideas across industries. \n\nWorking with plastic recycling, food manufacturers, fragrance manufacturers, auto companies, medical practitioners and others to enhance human flourishing.",
