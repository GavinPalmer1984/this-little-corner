 "description": "Michael and I explore topics for our upcoming conversation with Paul VanderKlay. \nGeorge Gilder article:  https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2012/09/the-materialist-superstition.html\nPVK on Peter Thiel convo with Eric Metaxas:  https://youtu.be/HwM1bn1Ggi8\nPVK message on the Resurrected Jesus as the Revelation of our Future Selves:  https://youtu.be/2KOmRQcC0QM\nPVK and Jonathan Pageau on Ontology https://youtu.be/P41EhuqYaMo\n\nIs knowledge anti-entropic? Or is only a certain kind of knowledge anti-entropic? What exactly is the error correction mechanism that allows our consciousness to filter out of the set of infinite facts a low enough resolution image to interact with? (PVK's \"religion is the JPEG of Being\" can be construed to mean that all of reality requires JPEGs that allow us to cope with the infinitude of available perceptions.\n\nWhen the crown of the tree is science, that creates a problem since\nTrust is an essential element for knowledge to compound. Recent generations, trust in science, or at least in scientism, has eroded and stopped the progress.\n\nIt's not good to have your basic models to be too over-optimized to a certain set of data. The closer your model is to a certain data set, the less useful it becomes for a wide range of domains. The rules of the meta game must be open enough to encompass the rules of all possible games. \n\nWe always have to have a lens.\n\nJordan B Peterson's lectures brought us back from pure intellectual cogitations to  something practical, inspiring us to make an extra effort to live for the highest ideals we could imagine, and also to mine that treasure trove for all that is there. In some way, what he did has been preparatory for the Body of Christ, sowing a new language so that the body might come into a coherent relationship of itself. The world is so complex that there are no \"right answers\". It is not an easy fix.",
