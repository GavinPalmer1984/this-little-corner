Whatever game He is playing with His creation, He has kept His own rules and played fair. He can exact nothing from man that He has not exacted from Himself. He has Himself gone through the whole of human experience, from the trivial irritations of family life and the cramping restrictions of hard work and lack of money to the worst horrors of pain and humiliation, defeat, despair and death. When He was a man, He played the man. He was born in poverty and died in disgrace and thought it well worthwhile.\u201d\n\nGreat authors (and their detectives)\nRex Stout (Nero Wolfe)\nDorothy Sayers (Lord Peter Wimsey)\nJosephine Tey (Alan Grant)\nAgatha Christie (Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot)\nEllis Peters (Brother Cadfael)\n\nAt the border between order/chaos, known/unknown, one finds both infinite tension and infinite release - the partaking of a paradox.\n\nOur desires are social, ends are many, not one. Like a detective working a room. The iconic detective is usually one stuck between recognition and repentance, on an edge, unable to move forward in his life.\nThe Trinitarian vision of writing a la Dorothy Sayers.\nThe Creative Idea (the first imagining of the work.)\nThe Creative Energy (the incarnating of the work, the writing it down)\nThe Creative Power (the meaning of the work, it being read)\n\nThe soul is always striving for the likeness. \nThe mutual gift giving in marriage.
