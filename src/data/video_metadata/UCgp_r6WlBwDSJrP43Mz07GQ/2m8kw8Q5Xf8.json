Example of a conditional relationship - the key and lock example we have been using in our discussion of computation.\ninput - sensory gathering - active state (choice, decision to act back on its environment)\nGeorge Ellis talk about algorithms being as real as physical objects.\nThe program is as real as any particle.\nWhat are the building blocks of the universe?\nThe Sam Harris types reject algorithms as real and will accept as real only particles. (fermions/bricks, bosons/force carrying)\nNow they are looking for particles that mediate space/time and gravity, hence they see information as particles.\nInformation is not just counting states.\nIn the Landauer sense, information is useful for defining relationships.\nExample: the profile of the key is information.\nAt the level of consciousness, pattern is equivalent to the key.\nAlgorithms - relationships.\nIf algorithms are real, then ideas are real, archetypes are real.\nIs math discovered or invented? If we can ask that question, we can also ask\nIs a work of art discovered or invented?\nIs a piece of music discovered or invented?\nAre the laws of physics discovered or invented?\nRegarding natural language and math logic - Frege search for what is in a word problems. T/ F conditional, laws of nature, rules of logic. \nIf something is acting intelligently, it is modeling an intelligent behavior (if/else/then action on its inputs)\nStrong emergence falls out of this directly. Strong emergence evidences collective intelligence.\nThose most against strong emergence are atheists, because if\narchetypes are real, absolute morality is real, woven into the universe.\nSee Nima Arkani Hamed YouTube The Morality of Fundamental Physics\n\nLayering phenomena - everything is nested.\nwhole/part relationship - parts interact based on certain rules, then it creates a new layer where the whole becomes a part of something bigger.\nInside/outside view is that within each layer of emergence, certain rules apply. Words and principles need to be defined within a certain layer.\nDefinitions applying within each level are a type of consciousness.\nStrong emergence eliminates that variable...\nConsciousness in one way is the universe of keys. What is available at that level of emergence.\nKarl Friston has some interesting ideas but Glen sees problems there, too.\nBook:  The Re-emergence of Emergence - but you don't need to read the book as all of the essay's authors are also on Closer to Truth if you search for emergence.\n\nSome say human consciousness is the only example of strong emergence because they don't want to deal with the implications of strong emergence at lower layers.\nThe physicalist sees weak emergence as all that's necessary. If you put enough stuff together, something happens, all explainable by physical laws. The physicalist says that if we just knew enough, we could explain everything.\n\nStrong emergence implies that something new happens which was not there before.\nArchetypes live above us - exercise top down causality, what is pulling us - transcendence.\nTrying to get rid of God is like throwing a boomerang, it always comes back at you.\nDavid Chalmers mathematician and philosopher has some interesting ideas on emergence, regarding decidability and deducibility.\nStrong emergence has implications for faith. Scripture tells us something about how we work. But if phyics can explain all this stuff, where do we find God?\nThe church is moving us farther and farther away from physical reality by trying to escape the physicist's conclusions. But strong emergence pushes us outside the physical universe.\nRelationships have to take a physical form before they can act in the world.\n\nMachine Learning, using cellular automata as a computational method. The work of Dave Ackley at U. of New Mexico.\nFaith - how does it work out in the real world.\nGrowing in faith - what does that mean?\nOur choices decide the future. Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead is an interesting play where the author keeps showing up.\nIf we have choice, then we are deciding the future with God.\nThis brings up questions of Open Theism.\nNext time, we will talk about Loss of Information.\n\nAlso, here's a playlist of our six-part series on the beginning of
