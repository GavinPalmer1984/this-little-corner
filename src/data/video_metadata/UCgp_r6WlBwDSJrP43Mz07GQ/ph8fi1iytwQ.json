 "description": "Chloe and I discuss the Great Father from the Maps of Meaning and the hero\u2019s journey.\n\nHer website is https://theoryofenchantment.com.\nCourse available at:  https://theory-of-enchantment.teachable.com\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00  Chloe Valdary discusses her background and her creation of The Theory of Enchantment training course. \n3:45  How do you teach people to love? \n4:30  Developing the Theory of Enchantment\n7:25  Question re the Hero's Journey\n7:55  Jordan Peterson\n9:20. Having a sense of wonder (trusting the good)\n11:45 Confronting the sense of one's own existence (mortality)\n13:30 Desire and skill achievement\n15:30 Need for a positive orientation\n19:00 \"Voluntary confrontation with emergent anomaly is the best bet.\" (Art and creativity)\n24:00 The Hero's journey is so meta. These stories are timeless.\n26:00 \"Those who climb the hierarchy with politics and power resent those who are climbing with competence and creativity.\" \n29:00 Political polarization arises out of a lack of self-knowledge.\n35:24 How long will you keep our souls in suspense? John 10:24\n36:45 Your self-worth is not rooted in holding the right opinion\n40:00 A balance of inquiry and orthodoxy\n42:45 We are always on the precipice of a rude awakening\n48:00 Limitation is necessary for creativity \n53:00 Need to keep the hierarchy from becoming so steep it's unclimbable\n57:30 Media incentivized to broadcast tragedy continually\n1:00:00 Positivity sells\n18:40  The adversary\n\nWe discuss Maps of Meaning and the Great Father in both His benevolent and tyrannical aspects.\nIntellectual curiosity, an awareness of one's own worthiness.\nEmotional maturity is needed to talk about complex conflicts.\nSearching for a way to teach love and wonder which are required to encounter the unknown with a sense that it is benevolent.\n\nThe fact of imperfection and our mortality as human beings...\nHow to avoid hyper political and desiccated speech - requires both orthodoxy and inquiry.\n\nDJ under the moniker Paradox. Ability to hold two opposing ideas in an opening that allows for consideration.\n\nKendrick LaMar's music:  Power, Poison, Pain and Joy inside my DNA\n\nCommunication is rife with difficulties which are infinitely magnified if every idea is automatically tied to an ideology. If you hear someone express an idea, you immediately presume that you know everything else that person thinks. That changes your view of them.\n\nIf you can separate the idea out from the person, you can discuss the idea logically, or even with passion if you want, but the discussion doesn't need to break the bond between the people.\n\nLove knows the other - is willing to enter into their world, accept them as the beloved, apart from their ideas. If you don\u2019t do this, when you hear an idea with which you don\u2019t agree, you judge the whole person and they become suspect. Every statement becomes suspect. True communication becomes impossible because now it is contaminated with judgment.\n\nPushing for conformity of ideology ultimately destroys love and makes diversity impossible.\n------------\nYour disadvantage is your superpower (overcoming hardship produces greatness) PVK\n-------------\nThe obstacle/anomaly is a gift. KW\nThe only real natural resource is honesty. JBP\nThe great Father - tradition, culture, history\nIngratitude tends to see only the tyrannical side of the Father, not the benevolent, creative\nAnd protective side.\n\nThe walled city - inside is safe from barbarians and chaos, but then, you are also trapped inside. Without walls, you are destroyed by barbarians. An ordered structure and a certain model of relationship - all of that constitutes the Great Father. \n\nWhat lurks behind tyranny is not freedom. It is chaos. Resentful young men are apt to become agents of chaos. \n\nThe benevolent father makes sure the hierarchy doesn\u2019t become so steep as to become unclimbable.\nTo be on the side of you that wants things to be good for you.\nTo narrow the influence of evil and to expand the influence of good.\nTell the truth to each other.\n\nWhat is needed - \nAdmirable non-political leaders\nApprenticeship to provide a means of building competence hierarchies of skilled individuals reaching back and lifting others up.\nSome youtube entrepreneurs are sharing life skills for free.\n\nJBP\nGratitude and humility\nInterest is your future calling you forward.",
