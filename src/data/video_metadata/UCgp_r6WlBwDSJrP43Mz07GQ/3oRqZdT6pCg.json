 "description": "In this conversation with Ira Katz, we discuss the book Ira and his brother Stanley wrote, Handling Mr. Hyde, which detailed Stanley's long struggle with bipolar disorder.\nStanley had a beautiful mind, highly gifted intellectually, extremely disciplined and organized and excelled in all of his educational pursuits, including an undergraduate degree in engineering and pre-med and completing a medical degree specializing in physiology.\nThe illness did not become apparent until he was 26 and working on his residency.\nThe book is in 8 chapters broken down into personal experience, physiological and behavioral problems, biochemical processes, treatment, free will, personal relationships, problems with bureaucracy and finally, how society deals with mental illness.\n\nIra relates his deep love and high regard for his brother and looks at way in which the illness would present as an entirely different personality, or person, one who was unrecognizable - no longer Stanley, but someone else entirely, hence the title, Handling Mr. Hyde.\n\nIra also discusses some of his personal philosophy which trends towards the libertarian, his appreciation of Von Mises, Friederich Hayek, Fredric Bastiat.\nThe two blogs Ira mentioned:  \nhttp://bionicmosquito.blogspot.com/p/the-book.html\nhttps://www.lewrockwell.com/author/ira-katz/",
