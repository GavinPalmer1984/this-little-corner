It takes excess energy to get things over the hump. It takes energy too create order and to maintain order.\nYou can only play the deconstruction game once.\nIrreversibility is a fundamental aspect of the universe. All the science silos have their own definitions of and formulas for entropy, but they all have one thing in common. The universe is fundamentally irreversible. The 2nd law is not driving time but is a consequence of that.\nThe laws of physics appear to be reversible, but is that just a function of the continuous and differentiable functions that physics is using to do the calculations? \nPhysics is always creating mathematical models that describe what we see in the universe around us, not what it is actually doing.\n\nComputation:  the simplest system is a finite state machine. The memory of the past is gone. Shows irreversibility in computation. Landauer's principle, Landauer's eraser.\nWhen you go through a logic gate, you lose information and entropy has gone up.\nTransistors need to be in a very specific order to be useful. \nEmergence crosses a barrier when something complicated becomes simple again. The inside v. the outside view.\nHilbert's decidability challenge. Turing worked to find out which problems are undecidable no matter how long the calculation runs.\nThe universe is putting new information into the system. Layers of emergence, the nested nature of systems - implies other layers above us.\nThe challenge is to create a system that can adjust moment by moment to its environment.\nEmergence:  starting from simple rules, you can create something that is undecidable. Computation turns information into energy. Ideas have a physical existence.\nTuring asked deep questions about what it means to be human.\nPhilip Clayton's book, Re-emergence of Emergence is linked below. Will discuss next time.\nDoes God know the future? Does God forget?\n\nOne of the better popular science video channels that tries to tackle the deeper questions in physics. \u201cPBS Space-Time,\u201d  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g\n \nFrom my point of view the best nontechnical introduction to Turing machines. \u201cTuring machines explained visually, (8:45-duration)\u201d https://youtu.be/-ZS_zFg4w5k\n \nIt might help in understanding how Turing machines work to see one in actual operation. People have constructed them in many different ways, including using LEGO\u2019s. \u201cLEGO Turing Machine, (2:22-duration)\u201d https://youtu.be/FTSAiF9AHN4\n \nWhile only a short clip was taken from this YouTube link, the complete interview is well worth listening to. \u201cComputers Without Memory \u2013 Computerphile, (8:51-duration)\u201d https://youtu.be/vhiiia1_hC4\n \nThe short presentation with George Ellis was taken from this fuller YouTube link. \u201cUnderstanding Consciousness | Rupert Sheldrake, George Ellis, Amie Thomasson, (43:40-duration)\u201d https://youtu.be/c-QOlTD0YHo\n \nNo doubt the best source of introductory interviews on the question of Emergence can be found here. Over the years the narrator Robert Kuhn has managed to interview all of the leading minds on the subject of Emergence. Most of the interview segments are short, 10 minutes, give or take. But in total, there are many hours-worth of individual interviews posted here. \u201cCloser to Truth, the PBS/public television series on cosmos, consciousness and meaning\u2026,\u201d https://www.closertotruth.com/search/site/emergence\n \nAnd for those who are more book oriented, and have had no previous exposure to the subject of Emergence, this collection of essays would be an excellent place to start. \u201cThe Re-Emergence of Emergence: The Emergentist Hypothesis from Science to Religion,\u201d
