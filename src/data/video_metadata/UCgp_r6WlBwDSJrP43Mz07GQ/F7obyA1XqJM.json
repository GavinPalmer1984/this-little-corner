 "description": "Causation and Emergence\nUnderneath all math, science and physics is the presumption that we are beings who can apprehend it.  How did that come to be?\nAlbert Einstein:  \"Perfection of means and confusion of goals, in my opinion, seem to characterize the age.\"\nScientists are not philosophically trained, trying to take over ethics without enough familiarity of he philosophy of ethics.\nEmergence - it's real, but we have no idea what it really means, how it comes to be and how it is existentially real.\nPhysical, Logical and Mental Causation\n\n\n\nSharon Glotzer on particle physics:  https://youtu.be/et5KcmdCXRk\nDr. James Tour:  https://youtu.be/zU7Lww-sBPg\nGeorge F. R. Ellis on Purpose:  https://youtu.be/FpfCDIhOxrE\nGeorge F. R. Ellis on the Moral Question:  https://youtu.be/fKObfyXIIg8",
