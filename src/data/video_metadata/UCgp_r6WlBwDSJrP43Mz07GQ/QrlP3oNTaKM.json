 "description": "How does information become reality?\nJonathan Pageau  calls symbol the meeting place of heaven and earth.\nWhat guides our vision is value.  Without value, we won\u2019t notice anything. There must be something that is salient and it is salient because we value it.\nThe source of all value is the transcendent.\nThe importance of gratitude.\nLove is a larger way of being. It enlarges our perspective. Increases our circle.\nVictor Frankl in Man\u2019s search for Meaning says that the only way you can know another person is to love them, to love who they can be, to see their potential and your own responsibility in helping that to come about in the way you interact with them.\n\nGratitude is a path toward become overwhelmed by the transcendent, by the miracles of the mundane.  Te develop an appreciation for the unfolding of the moment.\nWhat role does God play in our consciousness.  Who we choose to go down the path of \nVision, we\u2019re aligning with God.\nIn some sense, we are intended to be symbols of God, His image bearers to unfold His truth to the world.\nImagination leads to ideation leads to action.  Imagination must be embodied to become reality.\nGod is loving us into existence, seeing our potential, giving us agency to make choices.\nIn our story, we are loved by the author.  In some stories, it is obvious that the writer does not love the characters but only uses them for his own purpose, to create dramatic tension or to be a foil for jokes, but there is no life in such characters and they are not compelling.  We form long running attachments to characters who seem to have a life of their own and can grow and change over time - where it can be seen that the writer has an affection for the characters, flawed though they may be (The Office, Parks and Rec)\nLearning to see symbolically is a mode of perception.\nBarfield - words can have souls that contain within them the built-up meaning of history.\n\nOther videos with Michael and Alex at The Meaning Code channel:\nhttps://youtu.be/pgeWyufs_Jg\nhttps://youtu.be/L3qv60M_Bf4\nhttps://youtu.be/YB53BXXmWqk\nhttps://youtu.be/gbmm3l9HP4Q\nhttps://youtu.be/wiBdrgaJDdQ\nhttps://youtu.be/49yR5Jj04Sc\nhttps://youtu.be/YttxOqlLLaQ",
