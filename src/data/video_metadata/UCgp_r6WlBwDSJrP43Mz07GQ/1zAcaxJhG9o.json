What's in a Name?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zAcaxJhG9o", "date": "2020-06-11", "description": "Brad and Jeremy discuss two different models.\nJeremy's model of the Two Great Commandments, Love God and Love Your Neighbor and how that relates to structure and flexibility.\nBrad's model of the three loves of the Trinity. Christ and the church (marital love) Father and child (parental love) and sibling love. The family is the fundamental unit to show us who God is.\n\nLove means to fight on the side of someone who is struggling toward the light. Loving your enemy is part of loving your neighbor, your sibling.\nIdentity is tied to family. \nWhen a man gives his name to his wife, he is saying, \"I am now responsible to protect you and care for you.\" He is not taking ownership, but responsibility.\n\nOrthodox belief says all of the heresies come from misunderstanding the names of God or the nature of God..\nA name both separates and unifies at the same time.\nFather's main role is to encourage the children to confront the dragon.\nYou can't learn karate from reading a book. The family is where we learn about God whether we like it or not.\n\nInfidelity, divorce, damage your view of Christ and the church. \nRather than disciplining children, we should teach children to be self-disciplined.\nParenthood is the longest slowest breakup. Your job is to make yourself obsolete.\nThe Dad is supposed to teach emotional regulation. He's the one who does the rough and tumble play, getting the kids riled up and then calming them down.\n\nPeople join cults for a reason because they need structure.\nMarriage is the base unit for this structure. It is the whole reflection of God.", "duration": 5309, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hi Brad", "start": 1.49, "duration": 3.88}, {"text": "hi Jeremy it's really good to have you", "start": 3.27,
