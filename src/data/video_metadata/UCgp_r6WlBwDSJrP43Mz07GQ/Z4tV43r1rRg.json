In attempting to delineate the point of the thread, we discuss postmodernism, modernism, the Christian neoPlatonist tradition, and Owen Barfield's call to final participation. \n\nThe unknown and invisible always shine through the visible and the particular.\nOur participation in God is a fundamental part of our being. Aesthetic experiences lead us into a memory of participation.\nIt is necessary for the world to go through withdrawal from initial participation to get to the point of final participation, when it will be a choice to see the Transcendent, a choice to trust imagination as a faculty.\nIn Barfield's world, the meanings of words change over time indicating an evolution of consciousness, so when looking at literal and metaphorical meanings, the metaphor is primary.\nExample:  Pneuma is breath/spirit/wind - there is no separation between the material and the immaterial. For the ancients, the world of spirit was as substantial as the material.\nNo one wants to live in a world of dead objects. The Transcendent is always shining forth, and it only needs the enchantment of our vision to see it.\nIn order to recover the grail, you have to pass through the wasteland.\nWe are a tiny bit of the finite encompassed by the infinite.\nParticipation allows the Transcendent to shine forth to allow it to transform you.\n\nInspiration - literally, the spirit entering in.\nOriginal participation = paganism. We needed to pass out of it to gain a greater discernment.\nThe antichrist offers only a mundane enchantment. What's on offer is peace (but not the peace of God) and limitless consumption.\nFear of deception and illusion is a primary trait of modernity. We can't be so paralyzed by that that we are closed off by anything that scares us.\nAbsolute certainty is not open to you.\nPerelandra by C. S. Lewis is a retelling of the fall. What was forbidden to Perelandran Eve was to be on the fixed land. She needed to be only on the floating land until she was complete. If we are anchored to the dock, we can be steered. If we are on the fixed land, we are tethered to our addictions, to our ideological possession, to our extreme religious dogmatism.\n\nLink to the Hopf Vibration, a 3 sphere fiber bundle brought to
