 "description": "Owen Barfield, Saving the Appearances\nC. S. Lewis, Studies in Words\nMark Vernon\n\nA global event, with the virus occupying the world consciousness and changing the way everyone acts.\nA representation of an element of the chaos that has been there all the time but now we are forced to be aware of it.\nWhat it reveals about the fragility and brittleness of our current situation.\nOur current world system requires great precision to work, and the uncertainty precipitated by this virus has set chaos in motion.\nThe confrontation with suffering can lead either to nihilism (when you look to something outside yourself to explain the evil) or it can change how you see the world when you discover that your account of the world needed updating (when you look within to see how you have contributed to the problem and what you can do to solve it).\nThe holiest people in Dostoevsky's books see themselves responsible for everything.\nThe truth is always more powerful than the lie.\nReason v. Logic\nThe Unrepresented v. the Represented\nIcons v. Idols\nWe are finite creatures in a world of infinite facts. Because we make decisions on a moment to moment basis, we need an intermediary structure to squeeze infinity into something we can interact with. We need to update our representations all the time, a never ending ask.\nReason is the evermoreness of reality. It always has love embedded in it, the self-sacrificial nature of love. To come into alignment, something within you has to change shape to model the new thing.\nLogic on the other hand is locked in time. Ever true within its brittle form.\nIt has assumptions about the level of detail we can go into. It is useful as long as it works within its own system, but breaks down when you apply it to the real world.\n\nWhat you train your eye to see, you will see more of.You will bring that thing into being.\nC. S. Lewis' book, Studies in. Words\nAny word that gets taken up by any political movement loses its meaning because it has been coopted and becomes a synonym for either good or bad. There is no toleration for complexity.\n\nLogic leaves no room for mistakes.\nNow, however, we need to operate in a mode of being that affords an understanding of mistakes, that gives the latitude to brainstorm and think out loud without immediate judgement. There are no ready made answers to issues as complex as these, and answers will need to be found, sometimes painfully, moving forward together. If we continue in the adversarial model, we will sink.\nWill require doing rather than talking. We need to develop new practices with a complex view of what it means to be virtuous.",
