In previous videos,  Alex and I discussed resonance, critical mass, emergence, and the aggregation of color and light.  \n\nAlex's website:  \"Viewers can visit my website to see a primordial pattern and practice transforming chaos into symbolic meaning: http://cosymbolic.com \n\nKaren's website:  http://karenwongart.com\n\n\u201cMateriality is a medium of communication.\u201d  Paul VanderKlay\nIf every particle in the universe were perfectly equidistant from every other particle, is that the largest entropy possible?\n\u201cThe distribution with the largest entropy is the least informative default\u201d. \n\n1. Maximizing entropy minimizes the amount of prior information built into the distribution.\n\nOne can explain it as the spread-outness.  An example might be the way the heat in a cup of coffee spreads out to the air and to the cup.  You could also think of a messy room where things aren\u2019t where they should be but are spread out all over the place.  \n\n2.    Many physical systems tend to move towards maximal configurations over time.\n\nQuantum physics, non-locality as it relates to Opportunity Cost.  One choice prevents all others. \n\n\u201cReality is that which governs.\u201d (Paul VanderKlay) The universe is a certain way, and if we don\u2019t abide by the \u201crules\u201d, we face the consequence.\n\nBalance includes the principle of proportionality.\n\nArt - a pleasing composition has to have balance.  How do you find it?  It can be a lot of one thing, a little of another.  Unity with variety.  Mostly cool blues and lavenders, but with a focal point and a few touches of orange and yellow to keep it from becoming too rigid or boring.  \n\n Dominance brings unity and balance.  You achieve balance by having \nJust the right amount of repetition, variation, gradation.  Too much, chaotic, too little, boring\nThe right balance is like the edge, the wave, between order and chaos where Jordan Peterson says is the most creative, productive place to be.\nThat which is small and different gets the focus.\n\nBalance in the material world: An even distribution of weight - doesn\u2019t this have to include force and speed? A smaller, heavier, more active object will balance a larger, lighter, less active object.  \nA counteracting weight or force\nA condition in which different elements are equal or in correct proportions\nRemain in a steady position without falling. A state of potential dependent on the difference in height.\n\nThe cost of obtaining such information has to balance its benefits.\nIn Politics: The power held by a small group over larger groups - see Nassim Taleb article on the Dominance of the Minority from the book, Skin in the Game.  https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15\n\nFrom a lecture on entropy and probabilities https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/study/msc_and_phd/co904/co904online/lecture-3-4.pdf\n\u201cThe maximum entropy solution assigns zero probabilities only when no other possibilities are allowed. This is a very desirable property: it would be a sure failure to propose that a certain state has zero probability, and then find out that a given observation happened to yield that state. The Maximum Entropy solution is guaranteed not to fail there.\u201d\n\n(Note from The Meaning Code:  When no other possibilities are allowed, there is only one solution, or at least that\u2019s what he seems to say to me, and I wonder if this fits with the Glotzer lecture on particles self organizing into a crystalline structure when in a maximum constraint. https://youtu.be/et5KcmdCXRk\n\nSo, God in His goodness, allows us the minimum constraint so that there are many possible solutions to allow for maximum creativity, information and individuality.\n\n... the distribution with the largest entropy should be chosen as the least-informative default. The motivation is twofold: first, maximizing entropy minimizes the amount of prior information built into the distribution; second, many physical systems tend to move towards maximal entropy configurations over time.\n\nExplanation of the arrow of time and entropy where a seeming paradox is
