Cliche, Mind/Brain connection", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgeWyufs_Jg", "date": "2019-09-09", "description": "Confronting Reality vs. Retreating into Isolation\n\nInformation only becomes knowledge once it is lived out so that it can be determined to be true or false.  Our world today is awash in information, and the technologically connected are absorbing information at a dizzying pace, but not living it out, so there is no way to make sense of whether the information accords with reality.  We discuss this issue from the standpoint of symbol and quantum mechanics.\n\nSymbol is a coming together of heaven and earth (Jonathan Pageau on archetypes)\nEven words themselves are symbols.  Our human bodies are symbols.\n\nA symbol is a data structure that allows us to get information into small enough slots to absorb and to survive over time (MIchael)\n\nThat which you cannot articulate shows up in symbol.\n\nConstant flow of information has become chaotic and to a great extent, we\u2019ve lost the symbolic language that we used to all have in common (Alex)\n\nThe iPhone generation speaks to each other in memes and gifs.  That allows them to share large quantities of information about perspectives and emotional responses without ever having to articulate the perspective or access the emotional response.  This results in a lack of vulnerability and a lack of commitment to action. (Michael)\n\nRichard Mitchell, The Graves of Academe, on the degradation of language into bureaucratese resulting in ambiguity and the passive voice so there is no agency, no one responsible. (KW)\n\nSteve Wolfram put together simple rules and initial conditions of all particles\n\nAre symbols emergent manifestations of shared experience or\nDo symbols emanate, give something, more akin to imagination or an experience of the numinous? (Alex)\n\nSymbols can have a life of their own.  Barfield said words can have souls that contain within them the built up meaning of history over time. (Michael)\n\nCurrent scientific atmosphere is leading to reductionism, atomizing reality so that we are \nLosing the truth of objective meaning. \n\nModern symbols represent the new banal ambiguity. (Alex)\n\nTruth.  You can\u2019t have an intention to know truth unless you believe that truth is real.\nIf physicists no longer pursue truth or reality, what keeps them moving forward?\nPursuit of godlike powers of knowledge and control (Michael)\n\nWhen you encounter the transcendent, you can\u2019t help but become aware of your own deficiency, but that also opens up a huge landscape of possibility.  Contra, when you feel the lack of meaning and are falling into the abyss of meaninglessness, you also experience a vulnerability that opens you up to being rescued.\n\nThat abyss is the reciprocal narrowing G. K. Chesterton talked about (the insane man can\u2019t get away from himself because his circle is too small - the absolute certainty that he is right).\nWhen we come near God, we get a sense of what we are and who He is.\n\nThe liminal space of being between past and the future, in the now, is an experience of consciousness.  God\u2019s concern is for humans to have only two concerns, now & etermity.\nThe demons want us to focus on the past and on the future.\n\nIs general AI coming?  Not very likely. But even AI as it exists carries dangers if used as an aid in governance (infinite loops, etc.)\n\nJapanese Anime - Psycho-pass\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Pass\nLooks like you can watch it
