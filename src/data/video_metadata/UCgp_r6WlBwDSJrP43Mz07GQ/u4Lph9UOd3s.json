If anyone wants to do a comment with timestamps, I will be forever grateful.\n\nAt the end, Glen mentions John Walton and his reading of the first few chapters of Genesis. We talked about how great it would be to see a conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Walton, and after I started uploading this video, I saw that the Youtube Channel called Deep Talks had uploaded a video today of clips from those two, so here's the link to that:\n\nJordan Peterson v John Walton on Deep Talks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiSGdDc3bQY&t=2s\n\nThe art video from Chris Petkau that we mentioned:\nhttps://youtu.be/pYgUwolDuPs\n\nAnd Glen once again mentioned Nima Arkani Hamed's Morality of Fundamental Physics video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiSGdDc3bQY&t=2s\n\nHere's Wolfram on Lex Fridman # 124.
