 "description": "Conversation with Daniel Frank, a certified Practitioner of Generative Change.\nTo learn more or schedule an in-person or online session, you can email Daniela at daniel.m.frank@gmail.com.\n\nWe talked about Daniel's background in computer science, operating systems, analyzing and understanding data,  cybernetic models and computational learning.  Daniel also has an MBA in organizational control systems and a background and interest in Music and History of Thought, particularly the great thinkers of the early Christian Church, St. Augustine, St. Anselm, Nicholas of \nCusa.\n\nGenerative change therapy arises out of the teaching of Milton Erickson, Gregory Bateson, John Grinder and Richard Bandler. Grinder and Bandler also established NLP or neurolinguistic programming based on the idea that psychological problems arise from a paucity of language (finding the missing information).\n\nWe have incomplete maps of the world.  The map is not the territory.\nAntonio Damasio's book, Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain looks at the treatment of the mind/body dualism question, positing that rationality requires emotional input.\nRational thought is an overlay on our decision-making process.\nAlmost all behavior is habitual based on motor programs, but our brain structures are capable of enormous creativity. \nWhat happens when something in your environment changes and you have to find a new way forward, when you hit a key inflection point of your life?\nWhat was the solution to your problem at one point is now the problem.\nHow do you tap into the creative mode of cognition and thought?\nGenerative Change seeks to make a space for that to happen.\n\nhttps://Karenwongart.com",
