Time and interest are required to come up to speed.\nBorn in Ghana, grew up in Sudan, Yemen, parents are from India\n\nExtra dimensional thinking\nMichio Kaku believes there are other spatial dimensions. \nComplex numbers have exactly half as many dimensions\n\nYou are not your brain. You are not your body. You don\u2019t have a soul.\nYou are a soul. What you have is a body.\n\nIs the brain an interface to the soul? If it is, perhaps the Right hemisphere is the connection.\nLogic and reason have always existed. \nWe are a subset of reality. \nOntology: What is? Epistemology: And how do we know what is?\nPrincess Bride:  Reality bites. As you wish.\nUtopian thinkers want to force reality to meet their expectations.\n\nGod is outside the universe, but outside does not mean apart from, as a 3 dimensional creature is not apart from a 2 dimensional creature. It\u2019s just that the 2 dimensional creature would be completely unaware of the 3 dimensional creature because it could only see what is on its plane. God is omnidimensional and omnipresent.\n\nGodel\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem. There are things we know that we can\u2019t know from within the system. Logic and reason presuppose logic and reason. \nCharles Darwin and JBS Haldane\n\nJordan Peterson and his perspective of Truth.\n\u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be Jordan Peterson.\u201d\n\nHow do we know that truth exists?\nA suicide statement is a statement which refutes itself as soon as it is uttered.\nExamples:  My brother was an only child.   Never say never.   There is no truth.\n\nSome things are necessarily true. They would be true whether or not this universe existed.\nExamples:  Mathematics, Set Theory, Logic, Truth statements (example: if there were no universe, the statement \u201cThere is no universe\u201d would be true.)\n\nThat which is true whether or not this universe exists is a Transcendent truth.\n\nNext time, we will discuss Big Bang Theory, Cosmology, Quantum Computing, holographic processing, and Who is Agent X?\n\nProving God exists without using the Bible:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1448626196/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=jesisinvinpol-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1448626196&adid=11NJB21RS8HQR0KQFMFM&\n\nQuotes from Iain McGilchrist essay, The Divided Brain\n\n\u201cBut the most curious aspect of the story of the left hemisphere is yet to come. It turns on how a self-consistent system of signs, such as the left hemisphere's world, can come to seem more real than the lived world itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideal, theoretical world begins to triumph over that of experience.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026What is fascinating is the rationalistic left hemisphere's conclusion: not that this kind of logic has its limits in understanding the world, but that the experiential world somehow doesn't measure up to logic.\u201d\n\nEric Weinstein Portal conversation with Roger Penrose\nhttps://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-portal/20-sir-roger-penrose-plotting-the-twist-of-einstei/\n\nIain McGilchrist essay\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Divided-Brain-Search-Meaning-ebook/dp/B008JE7I2M/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=The+Divided+Brain&qid=1580331472&sr=8-3\n\nN.
