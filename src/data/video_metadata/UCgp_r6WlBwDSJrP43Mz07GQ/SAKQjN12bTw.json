 "description": "Owen Barfield by DiFuccia\nSaving the Appearances by Owen Barfie\nMaps of Meaning by Jordan B. Peterson\n\nActive (poein) and passive (paschein)\nPassive/suffer/permit\nInitiate/respond\n\nMeaning is where the immanent meets the transcendent. Our practical connections ton the truth is of primary importance. Take note of whether you are \"coming together\" or have a sense of dissipation (disintegration) - moving further from the core of who you are. Meaning on a grand scale is a culmination of all the smaller stories to create a transcendent meaning.\n\nThe modern tries to displace God by being God ourselves.\nSurrender requires believing that we would be surrendering to someone good. Postmoderns seem to believe that reality is a bad gift.\n\nWe have a static picture of what will make us happy. Models provide a simplification of reality.\n\nWe want the skills, the process. Built into wonder is gratitude, the soreness of reality. Mysticism keeps men sane (Chesterton). We want to control and predict, but reciprocal narrowing hijacks a legitimate process. We end up with an inability to reintegrate the information from that smaller frame into the larger frame.",
