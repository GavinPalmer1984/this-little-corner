 "description": "Skip to 6:45 if you want to bypass the intro stuff.\nJeremy talks about his ideas of how the Two Great Commandments, Love of God and Love of Neighbor, relate to Structure and Flexibility.\nSkyscrapers, Buildings, architecture, and Pagodas.\nPagodas are built around a central tree which gives structure, and the floors are movable, which lends flexibility, so that the pagoda can survive earthquakes.\nToo much flexibility, we fall into chaos, ruled by our passions, possible enmity towards God. Mending Walls by Robert Frost.\n\nToo much structure, we become rigid and unable to adapt to the moment.\nLaws become rules, ethics become morals. Become obsessed with details and totally miss love, justice and truth. Impossible to truly understand the law without love.\nThe purpose of rules is to reduce complexity, but if we codify them, they become rigid. Principles over rules. Becomes especially noticeable in bureaucratic systems in which two rules can be contradictory.\nWhen we fall away from order and flexibility, we simultaneously develop enmity toward God and our fellow man.",
