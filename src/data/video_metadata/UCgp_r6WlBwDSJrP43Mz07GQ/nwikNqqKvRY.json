He wants to approach this topic from the standpoint of a specific shared set of definitions of terms, so we begin by recapping Episode 2 definitions of complexity, chaos, order, and entropy, and then take a deep dive into the history of the concept of entropy and its importance.\n\nTo understand thermodynamic systems, you. have to look at the differences between the inside and the outside.\nKolmogorov complexity measure\nThe inside can be very complex, but once you cross the boundary to the outside, the complexity is greatly reduced in terms of how you interact with it.\nExample:  a watch is highly complex on the inside, but you interact with it through the hands and that is much less complex. Once the boundary is crossed the complexity transforms.\n\nChaos can be looked at in various ways - from an archetypal context to an emotional state to the strict definition it has within physics.\n\nWhen something is disordered, there is still a reference point you can go back to, but in chaos, there is no reference point.\n\nThe matrix of predictability and determinism.\nDeterministic but not predictable - this describes chaotic systems\nUnpredictable and non-deterministic - a true random number generator\nPredictable but non-deterministic - a computer running a program\n  (there's some intelligence out there that we are responding to)\n\nInformation - Julian Barbour article, Bit from It.\n  In the Shannon sense - how many bits\n  In the sense of telling you something useful (i.e. tall or short, which\n    can encompass a lot of different states. Yes/No questions\n    don't necessarily map to number of states.\nIn the sense of black holes, holographic principle.\nIn the sense of semantic information\n\nChaos - strange attractors are acting in phase space.\n  Order coming. out of chaotic systems (unpredictable, but they are\n  bounded)\n  Shapes in multiple dimensions. Your brain is not made to see the world\n  the way Mother Nature sees it.\n\nEntropy - most definitions are incomplete. Ex: a measure of disorder, a measure of number of states - statistical mechanics (Boltzmann)\n\nbut 20 years before that.\nLate 1700's - steam engine, heat going in, mechanical work coming out.\nJoule discovered that meat and mechanical work were the same thing.\n  1st law of thermodynamics - Conservation of Energy\nCarnot - early 1800's - maximum efficiency, hot minus cold divided by heat\nLord Kelvin - concentrated on the heat stroke\nClausius - had to include the return stroke, the compression, to view it \n  as a cycle. In the return, the waste heat gets dumped.\nThe entropy gets transferred at the moment you begin cleaning up the bedroom.\nHeat transfer divided by temperature\nEntropia - to transform - a transformation current makes sure the energy doesn't get into trouble (like a big brother)\nChange or flow in energy divided by the temperature\n\nEntropy is a bookkeeping device to make sure that you don't violate Carnot's principle.\nHow much free energy depends on the difference between hot and cold.\nEntropy is the mileage indicator for the disorganization, not the disorganization itself.\nCarnot - The max efficiency is T hot minus T cold divided by T h\nKelvin - perfect engine\nClausius - perfect refrigerator\n\nEntropy is. qualitative metaphysical statement. You can't go backwards.\nThe big question is does the arrow of time only move forwards because of entropy? Or does the second law occur (does entropy always increase) because the arrow of time already has a direction?\n\nPeople assume science is a step by step process - but you stare at it for a long time, and then one day, the answer comes.\n\nQualitative boundary between the inside and the outside.\nInside: thermodynamic entropy ( states/probabilities/energies)\n  tends to maximum disorder, only works at thermal equilibrium\n  Probability of going. back is vanishingly small.\nOutside:  Out of equilibrium will tend towards a new equilibrium and tend towards maximum forgetfulness. You can't go back because you have no idea whereto came from. (self-organized criticality & complexity economics.\n\nAny living system will degrade over time. Can't reproduce a living system from an adult because errors have already crept in over time.\nTo keep renewing and restoring, you need an original copy (DNA)\n  a roadmap, a copy of the original state (DNA, sexual reproduction - combining two different copies acts as an error correction mode)\n\nEntropy increases always when you are trying to do work - a less then perfect conversion.\nA transformation of entropy from one side to the other side goes up.\n\nWhen omplexity on the inside is hidden, you're dealing with a simple object (emergence.\nWeak emergence -boundary is artificial - cylinders, pistons, etc.\nStrong emergence - system is making its own boundary (self-organizing,  maintaining its own boundary.\n\nPlaylist for the whole 6 part series:
