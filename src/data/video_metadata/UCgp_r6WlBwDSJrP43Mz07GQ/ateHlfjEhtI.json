 "description": "Karl continues to flesh out his philosophy.\nRejects the binary choice between a materialistic world view and a world that necessitates the supernatural.\nCan live with the ambiguity of how it all began.\nReligion has been useful.\nEnlightenment was not a reaction against Christianity, but it came about because of Christianity.\nRational inquiry gives us a glimpse into the universe, and religion provides a moral ground.\nThe concept of the dignity of the individual started with Jesus.\nOur cultural history is important.\nDistributed cognition is culture.\nPolitical views are conservative/classical liberal.\nGuy Sengstock, \"It takes all of your freedom to deeply obey something.\"\nKW - This says something fundamental about the universe and quantum physics and God's participation in the dance. This connects to the n-body problem, for the law of gravity (whatever you claim it to be) changes in nature somehow or requires more complicated calculations the more bodies that are involved, because each exerts its own gravity (or modifies space time) or responds in its own way (to spacetime) in response to the other bodies involved.  Multiply this effect not only with gravity but with all the other constants that describe the structure of the universe and you can see that there needs to be both the ultimate in flexibility (freedom) in how those laws respond to each other and the ultimate in obedience in how the universe exhibits the characteristics of these laws.\n\nKarl's recommendations:\nNassim Taleb - Skin in the Game\nJoseph Henrich - The Secrets of Our Success",
