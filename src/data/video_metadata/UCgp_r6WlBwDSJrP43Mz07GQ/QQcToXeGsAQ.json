Did you have to work at developing that style? These stories are desperately sad and painful, yet without sentimentality. Just honesty in your plain description of their circumstances.\n\nYou introduce us to the very real people that have been affected by economic choices that were made in the face of rising global competition.\n\np. 50\n\u201cIn the name of economic growth, more efficiency and higher profits, we opened our borders to a flood of cheaper products coming in and a flood of factories and jobs moving away\u2026 to lower labor costs, no matter what.\u201d\n\nWhat, in your estimation, would have been a more productive stance to have taken in the face of the existing growth of global competition?\n\nHow that addiction has affected their lives. Did you develop your interest and study of addiction after you started this project, or before?\n\nJohn Vervaeke, The Meaning Crisis, reciprocal narrowing. Relationship between agent and arena, or individual and world they inhabit. Your world becomes a little smaller - I can\u2019t continue my job because the drugs affect my thinking. My lack of a job narrows my world - no entertainment, no travel, no options. That reinforces my dependence on the drugs. My world gets narrower. I can\u2019t do that thing because I need to get my next hit. And on down it goes. \n\nYour description of this world shows clearly the impact of addiction and lack of education. \n\np. 284\nEDUCATION\n\u201cWe have said that education is the way out of pain and the way to success, implying that those who don\u2019t make it out are dumb, lazy, or stupid.\u201d That\u2019s one way to see the implications, but not a necessary one. If we say that education is not the way out of pain and the way to success, what exactly have we achieved? We will always bump up against reality.\n\nAddiction starts way early for many of these people, even in junior high. That obviously affects their ability to focus on school to get a high school education. The 3 factors that have the most impact on a future without poverty are a high school education, marriage and waiting until marriage to have children. Many of those you met had children in their teens. It sounds like any intervention needs to come much much sooner.\n\nAfrican American pastor was asking for tutors for kids grade 3 through 5 to help them get their reading up to grade level as that would greatly increase their opportunities for flourishing as adults.\n\nStudents who were not proficient in reading by the end of third grade were four times more likely to drop out of high school than proficient readers. In fact, 88 percent of students who failed to earn a high school diploma were struggling readers in third grade.\nThird grade has been identified as important to reading literacy because it is the final year children are learning to read, after which students are \u201creading to learn.\u201d\u00a0If not proficient readers when they begin fourth grade, as much as half of the curriculum they are taught will be incomprehensible.\n\n3 things.\nFinish High School\nDon\u2019t have a child before twenty\nGet married, then have a child.\n\nWhat if we had a story for children that you can have a meaningful life filled with promise, and that the first step on that journey is learning to read? What about using phonics so that all children would have the opportunity to read at or above grade level? Rudolf Flesch - Why Johnny Can\u2019t Read\n\n\u201cTrue compassion is doing what is right for someone. A parent doesn\u2019t do their kid any good letting them blame the world for their problems.\u201d\n\nAn ideology leaves no room for uniqueness. The agenda requires that all see through the same lens, all come to the same conclusion. \n\nAlso, addiction leaves no room for uniqueness. Addiction reduces everyone down to the same common denominator. Desperate need and a willingness to do anything to meet that need.\n\nReciprocal broadening - become a little more open, more flexible in thinking, then you get more curious and learn more. That broadens your horizons and shows you more possibilities. Your arm gets higher. You learn more, grow more.\n\nAt the mention of Jordan Peterson, Chris Arnade mentioned right wing and alt-right movements. JP has no connection with such movements and no affinity.\n\nAGENCY.  When you tell someone, the system is against you, what does that accomplish?\nIf the system is the problem, I have no agency and also have no responsibility.",
