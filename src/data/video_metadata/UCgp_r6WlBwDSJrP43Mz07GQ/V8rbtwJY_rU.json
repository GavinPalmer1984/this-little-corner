Looked for meaning in church but eventually fell into agnosticism.\nBecame fascinated with Kierkegaard about 10 years ago.\nDived into philosophy.\nThe margin of the whole circle of Christendom.\nThe imagining of the context.\nThings that matter.\nIcons - they are not portraits, but portals into another way of seeing reality.\nMusic is a way of painting sound. Sonic painting.\nWhen we consider an idea, is it still an idea, or is it an idea about an idea?\nBeauty is a zip bomb.\nJesus answers then problem of the one and the many.\nIs the one always primary to the many, or is it a summation? In Jesus, it is both.\n\u201cWherever you find beauty, you find symmetry, a place of reconciliation, a kind of measuring together using the same measuring rod.\u201d Quoting who?\nBeauty entreats us, leads us forward.\nLike the Esther Lightcap Meek idea of all knowledge beginning as a gift from the One and when the gift is received, we develop a loving relationship with the knowing.\nTelling the truth, because language is a choice. Every word we use is a moral arena.\nFractals, the mandelbrot set, have parallels in the liturgical life.\nAround age of 25, people have a tendency to settle for a habit, and if that habit is upset, it can become disorienting, a kind of cognitive dissonance and one can wake up to the challenges of reality again. Matt fell into agnosticism and nihilism.\n\nTwo years in the call center in Lincoln, NE brought a realization, and he began the trek to California.\nFaith is a passion, not a logic.\nThe narrative order.\nCognition is embodied, needs a motor output. \u201cI do believe\u201d says Jordan Peterson.\nDo is an action word. Belief must have an action component.\nLed to Eastern Orthodox sacramentality.\nJoined a Russian Orthodox Church after having a noetic experience of God\u2019s presence.\nThe nous is he place in us in which the presence of God occurs.\n\nOrwell\u2019s essay on the proper use of language for clarity of
