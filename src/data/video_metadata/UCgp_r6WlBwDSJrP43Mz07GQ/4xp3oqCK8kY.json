She tells her life story, how she learned to \"tell the truth, at least don't lie\" and we discuss ideas from her latest essay on responsibility.\n\nGreat video by JBP - for the section I played, go to 1:46:00, but I recommend watching the whole thing. The deeper the abyss, the brighter the light. https://youtu.be/dPv1RYsi7sA\n\nAn essay about Magdalena's story by Annette Poizner, another frequent guest on this channel:  https://inspiredhumans.pub/jordan-peterson-the-thrift-store-wig-80b9270dd4f1\n\nYou can find more of Magdalena's writing at her Facebook page:   https://www.facebook.com/magdalena.jaroszak\n\nThese are quotes that I abstracted from her essay on The Paradox of Absolute Freedom:\n\n\"How can people feel free when they lack one of the most necessary factors for true freedom - a clear conscience?\"\n\nThose who underestimate their potential are \"victims of the dictatorship of a pragmatic, comfortable and very temporary world...being pushed by winds of comfort and no responsibility.\"\n\n\"An absolute freedom that lacks a sense of responsibility can powerfully blind the will to help, love and be present.\"\n\nMickiewicz teaches \"measure your strengths against intentions.\" Why not intentions against strengths instead?\n\n\"Schools indoctrinate according to temporarily adopted norms, but how little they teach us about what is timeless, universal - about family, related to its duties.\"", "duration": 5683, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "i'm delighted to be here today with", "start": 4.24, "duration": 2.96}, {"text": "magdalena", "start": 5.759,
