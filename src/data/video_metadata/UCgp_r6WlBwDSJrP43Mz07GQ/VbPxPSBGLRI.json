 "description": "Alex and I begin a multi-episode project to summarize Maps of Meaning, beginning with Jordan Peterson's letter to his father describing his motivations for writing the book. From here, we will move on to the last 20 pages of the book and discuss ideas as they come to mind. \n\nWe discuss the historical milieu that surrounded Jordan Peterson as he was working on this book, how choice dictates our future, and our obligation to the larger community to communicate our experiential DNA.\nLink to Paul Vanderklay discussion with Jordan Peterson:  https://youtu.be/aUGGrZUFMg4",
