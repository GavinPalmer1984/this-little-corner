In this conversation, we sought a shared framework of understanding, but for a big idea like this, more than one conversation will be necessary. \n\nThe three planes of existentially:  Ideational, Genetic, Physiological\nThe will to perceive is at war with the reality of power.\n\nIdeational is the will to have your ideas lived out in others consensually (voluntarily) rather than coercively or cooperatively.\n\nApex existentially corresponds to Ecclesiastes 3:11 \"He has placed eternity in your hearts.\"\n\nThe heart of flesh v. the heart of stone (which represents certainty, absoluteness, a desire to rule the world)\n\nGod is the source of value and not value itself.\n\nIdeas are not as important as the vehicles through which they're expressed.\nThe authority which possesses the factitious (the high quality material means of communicating) can convince anyone of anything.\n\nHumiliation, humility, is the path to making space for Jesus to live in you so that His life in your life makes you more of who you are meant to be as a vital member of the body, the whole yet part of the whole, unity in diversity.\n\nNext time, we will view a graph Paul has created to explain his idea and we will also explore his definitions of meaning, freedom and value.", "duration": 6311, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "i'm delighted to be here today with paul", "start": 2.399, "duration":
