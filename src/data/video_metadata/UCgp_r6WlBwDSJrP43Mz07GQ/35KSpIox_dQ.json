 "description": "Karl graduated from U. C. Berkeley in Engineering Physics, spent 24 years in Air Force as a fighter pilot, American but grew up in France, lived in the U. S., France, the UK, Korea and Germany, plus many other countries.\nLoves Philosophy, science,\nAstounded by Paul VanderKlay and his openness and depth of interest.\nComplexity theory and emergence\nRequires just the right amount of randomness.\nOrder imposed from the top will eventually collapse a complex system.  This is why Marxism and Fascism were doomed to fail and why they did so much damage in the 20th century.\nInitially exposed to complexity from reading Friedrich Hayek, spontaneous order out of human action, not human design.\nKarl Popper - we are a universe open to novelty.\nThe randomness we observe may at times reflect our ignorance of deeper explanations.\nRecently reading Stuart Kauffman\u2019s Reinventing the Sacred.\nLikes Roger Penrose, doesn\u2019t like the ideas of Donald Hoffman\nPhilip Dick\u2019s definition of reality, \u201cthat which when you stop believing in it, still doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d\nHe accepts the reality of God #1, a non-active God, the immutable laws of the universe, the Logos (logic) to which we are all subject.\nHe believes that when rational consciousness arose, there was not a new branch of normative law. The human-made positive law is supposed to reflect the natural law, but he says the only place in the world that has formally codified that is the United States.",
