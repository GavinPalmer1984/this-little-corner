Scientism and What Does Panpsychism Have to do with Disenchantment?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEYnlIqaGh4", "date": "2021-10-28", "description": "In this Part 2 of a longer conversation, Nancy Pearcey, awarded winning author of Finding Truth and other great books (see Bio below), discusses the modern and postmodern search for meaning in a disenchanted world. We roam through various reductionisms and the postmodern trajectory that runs through Hegel turned upside down by Marx and finally into Romanticism's attempt to regain beauty and meaning, all of which is the seeking of a substitute but results in incomplete ideologies.\n\nPart 1 which covers Nancy Pearcey's story, the main theme of her book and the various kinds of reductionism can be found here:  https://youtu.be/qVd6QyQ4N9I\n\nAlso I mentioned the YouTube channel, The Anadromist, and his publishing of the lectures by Hans Rookmaaker. Here is a lecture on art.  https://youtu.be/zSdYF__ZWt4\n\nNancy's Bio:\nNancy Pearcey is the author of Love Thy Body: Answering Hard Questions about Life and Sexuality. Her earlier books include The Soul of Science, Saving Leonardo, Finding Truth, and two ECPA Gold Medallion Award Winners: How Now Shall We Live (coauthored with Harold Fickett and Chuck Colson) and Total Truth. Her books have been translated into 12 languages. She is professor and scholar in residence at Houston Baptist University. A former agnostic, Pearcey has spoken at universities such as Princeton, Stanford, USC, and Dartmouth. She was highlighted as one of the five top women apologists by Christianity Today and was hailed in The Economist as \"America's pre-eminent evangelical Protestant female intellectual.\"", "duration":
