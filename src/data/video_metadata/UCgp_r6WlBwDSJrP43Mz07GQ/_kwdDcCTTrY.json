This points out the importance of technology.\nHistory is written by the academics.\n\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance speaks of the proper life for a man being one who lived in harmony with nature. The Greeks did this, but they couldn't check their theories because the climate of opportunity hadn't arisen yet. \n\nGreek scientific thought had sputtered out long before the appearance of Christians on the scene.\n\nPtolemy came later but still very early in the millennium and he was a very rigorous \"scientist\", 400 to 500 pp of math look up tables mapping the orbits of the planets.\n\nIt wasn't until Galileo that science surpassed that of the Greeks. This was because Galileo had the telescope, which was because the technology of lens making had sprung up, which was because people had started reading and needed reading glasses so people could make money off of making lenses of optical quality. Galileo pushed that envelope and developed astronomical quality lenses.\n\nUnderneath all that has to be a trust network. See Cesar Hidalgo's work.\nThe Greeks didn't have that. The decimal number system began in India with the merchant class when there was a commercial need for it. That democratized it so it was no longer a secret of the elite.\n\nAlso, Galileo was knowledgeable regarding artillery - a need to see the flight of cannonballs through space. Through this the theories of Aristotle were seen to be wrong. \nTycho Brahe did all the research work that Kepler later used in determine the ellipse of orbits. This was based on doing astrology for rich people. Astronomy has always been big science. The Persians believed that people were controlled by the movement of the planets and celestial bodies so they were willing to invest money at the national level. Christians did not believe that, so they weren't willing to invest in that at the national level. \n\nLawrence Krauss dismissed religion completely, but he is a big supporter of the Large Hadron Collider which has cost 10's of billions of dollars and employs 10's of 1000's of people - a giant pyramid with the LHC at the top. That is a complex of trust networks.\n\nPeople have always framed hypothesis, testing and seeing what works and what doesn't. It's how we live in the world.\nPlus, if you're going to build a trust network, it has to be tied to seeing beyond the here and the now.\n\nNima Arkani Hamed talks of wonder and curiosity (maps onto Faith and Science), and that there is something bigger out there that we need to pay attention to.\nIt's curiosity pulling them forward. An objective notion of right and wrong. Experiments show who is right and wrong. Physics is done through mathematical language. Truth with a Capital T is going to be appearing everywhere.\nIn science - what works and what doesn't. Truth had better come before everything.\nThe longing\nOur language has evolved to encapsulate the world around us correctly one generation to the next. Our natural language is tied to the world around us.\nDarwinian idea implies that language and truth have a covenant together. This covenant has to be held sacred if you are going to survive as a society.\nTrust - action - stepping out. Once trust is broken then language is no longer trustworthy.\nOrwell, Richard Mitchell (Less Than Words Can Say)\n\nCesar Hidalgo - google talk and his book.\nHe starts at the level of entropy up through the level of computation.\nThe complexity of choices is a function of the size of the community.\nDistributed computation.\n\nNetworked computers together exhibit group behaviors that no individual one can have. This is strong emergence happening at the level of AI.\nCesar Hidalgo applies this to the level of societies and cultures. The size of your trust networks - collective intelligence.\n\nFree exchange of ideas & of wealth - distributed non-centralized economic system. You need to grow your economy.\n\nCooperative behaviors can also be competitive.\nNow there is no element in our society that holds truth sacred. Even the church has abandoned the field willing to use the Bible for its own purposes.\nC. S. Lewis was the only one who was courageous enough to go and meet the other side.", "duration": 5125, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "i'm here again today with glenn", "start": 3.28, "duration": 3.599},
