Their vulnerability without the shell, the phase transition when the shell is too tight just before they break out into something new.\n\nThe Map of Meaning is buried in the unconscious, so we need to work with the unconscious to manifest these shifts.\nDr. Poizner uses Projective Personality Assessment to clarify the dynamic of the unconscious mind.\n\nRestructuring the self is like the alchemical process cited by Jung, as we are choreographed into the birth of the higher self.\n\nProjective Personality Assessment takes into account talents, world view, undercurrents of the personality, which show up in handwriting, art, stories, dreams, earliest memories.\nWhen the diagnosis is correct, the cure begins.\n\nNon-dominant clinical approaches:\n5 element theory of Chinese Medicine\n\nWood, water, fire, earth, metal\nMothering Cycle:  Yes. water mothers wood, mothers fire, mothers earth, mothers metal mothers water and the cycle starts again.\nFathering Cycle: No. Father sets a limit. Water sets a limit on fire, etc.\nEach governs part of our physiology and psychology. Example:  water governs the kidney meridian relates to the sage and to wisdom.\nWhere is your center of gravity?
