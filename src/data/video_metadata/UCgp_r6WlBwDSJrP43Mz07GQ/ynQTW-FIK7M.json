We are going to die and don't have all the time in the world to figure things out.\nHow do you conceptualize the life you've been given? Gift? or Burden?\nSuffering produces a pressure to push out the parts of me that I don't like.\nWe all need a heaven to go towards and a hell to run from.\nDecision making results from habits of thought that are laid down over years. These shape our perceptions of the world.\nAlpha thinking and beta thinking.\nEvery action, every decision, has a moral component to it.\nTurning from the bad to the good gets laid down into your hardware.\nWho are you? A story, a data compression of deep patterns and associations developed over all of your decisions.\nWho do you want to be?\nWhat moved Michael from faith and then back to faith was looking at God #1 and God #2. He grew up in a faith that was narrowly focused on a small sliver of life, not a god of the whole world, but only of a separate small sliver of reality.\nThe manifest image and the scientific image - there is a coherence between these two.\n\nFear, the desire to know the truth of things in the right here and now.\nIt's difficult to commit to a process when you don't know how it's going to turn out.\nWe are all in the process of something. We have intuitions of what is good and what is not good. Some of the greatness of what we do is hidden from us.\nEvangelicalism has focused on God #2 and on the mercy aspect so that some have turned to that as an excuse. Others have turned perfection into its own sort of game.\nBeing or becoming? Skin in the game?", "duration": 5268, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "this is the meaning code where we look", "start": 2.0, "duration": 3.759}, {"text": "for the metaphors that reveal the hidden",
