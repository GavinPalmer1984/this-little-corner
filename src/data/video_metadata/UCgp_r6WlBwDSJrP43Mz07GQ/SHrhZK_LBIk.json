True communication is an act of love and sacrifice, with a necessity of dying to self, and a consequence of expanding together with each one reshaping to another's shape, even as they reshape to the shape of the other.\n\nTheurgy is the story of God's working together with us, God's divine will and our will. Radical Orthodoxy seeks to knit together a world that has been sundered, to undo the sacred/secular distinction.\n\nThales had the idea of the arche, the first principle of all things, but he thought it was IN the universe. It is not reason v. faith or reason v. realization, but rather the immanent and the transcendent together.\n\nAquinas thought theology was about God and all things in relation to God, so in other words, theology was about ALL things. Theology was at that time the queen of the sciences, and physical science was within the theological frame. All human making and doing was seen as sacred.\n\nThe human always points to the supernatural.\nLife is liturgically practiced for ordinary and extraordinary time.\nKnowing another requires self-sacrifice.\nKnowing, Loving, Communicating - all acts of agape.\n\nLiturgy - training the will to choose the good without volition getting in the way. (Note to self: this is equivalent to developing an artistic process and being so familiar with the framework of the elements and principles of design that you can move into flow state so that you can keep self out of the way as you work. So then, is artistic practice a form of liturgy?)\n\nThe garden is a story about liturgy. (Note to self: ask Matt more about this later, especially his comment about the good fruit and entropy).\n\nThe peculiar is consecrated. (Note: is the peculiar related to the anomaly?) Matt says the word \"expectation\" means \"from the heart\".\nEros - God wooing us, the reciprocal pattern and the oneness of the thing you're interacting with.\n\nEros - desire itself is self-constraining, for in the grip of eros or desire we do not see everything else within view, but only this one thing. But in one sense, that frame is not one we choose but rather one that is imposed upon us.\n(Note: we focus on that which is above the horizon in order to frame our view of the infinite potential of the next moment, and that brings in to our frame what we need to realize our vision, so in a sense, desire (interest, the golden thread, our future) calls us forward. Is there a difference in the way each of these operate?)\n\nHuman making is liturgy.\n\nKenosis and its relation to chasm. Liturgical moves are chiastic explosion.\n\nDivine presence enters into the collective human effort. Dia Logos.\nGod comes in to the middle in spite of all our shortcomings.", "duration": 3330, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "sounds good i am really happy to be here", "start": 0.96, "duration":
