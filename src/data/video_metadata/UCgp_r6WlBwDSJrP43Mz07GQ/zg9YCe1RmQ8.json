Karen, Nate and Michael attempt to get through just 7 minutes of the most densely packed conversation on the internet (from 21:30 to 29:00)\n\nHere are some notes, but we were going so fast, note taking was sporadic at best.\n\nThe Paul Kingsnorth article Nate mentioned:  \nhttps://www.firstthings.com/article/2021/06/the-cross-and-the-machine\n\nThe Golden Thread. Nate's take is that it maps on to Telos. Karen's take, it is JBP's reference to the Phenesthai, \"interest\", shining out in front of us that leads us forward, our future calling to us.\n\nThe Christline pattern of being - that which is kenotic in relation to God the Father\n\nJBP connects God the Father to memory when he discusses the ancestral spirit that goes back over time.\n\nNate: A denial of one's own contingency - bear your own existential burden on your own. Why or how you exist - is it on your own terms? If you confront them honestly, there's nothing about you that's necessary. You are not required. All of creation is fully contingent.\nKaren: Now that sounds like Lawrence Krauss:-)\n\nNate:  Yes.\n\nMichael's comment on contingency being pre-creation. All chips on the table with each creative act.\nWe become vital parts of the story.\n\nPattern and Indwelling.\nHolographic - the external you.\nThe uncreated light\nA data compression reference. \nThe part having the whole in it - the networks of connection. We are little versions of the Trinity.\n\nMichael remembers hearing JBP say once, \"Each. human consciousness is a center of the universe.\"\n\nBorges:   Whatever one man does,  it is as if all men did it.\n\nNate reminds that \"infinite\" itself is an apophatic term.\nA hologram comes into being by shining through.\nGod.is pure act. The One who actuates all motion\n\nMichael:  Critique has been confused with creative act.\n\nIntuition is a spiritual sense of touch.\nDiscernment is needed, but it too can get caught up in an ideological movement.\n\nA false option:\nExtreme individualism or give ourselves up into some collective spirit that is not the Holy Spirit.\n\nMichael:  The lexical and  the speaker's meaning - the letter and the Spirit - both open up into a huge expansion of possibility - non-identical repetition\n\nChrist, the Logos, integrally related to creation. Christ likeness in different places, connects to all of creation. The mediation point for matter. In Him, all things hold together.\nMichael quotes from Chapter 1 of Speaker's Meaning on Polarity v. Paradox.\nthe two aspects of Polarity exist by virtue of each other as well as at each other's expense.\n\nQuantitative v. Qualitative.\nthe Quality of Oneness\nThe Quality of Threeness", "duration": 5626, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "i am so happy to have nate here with me", "start": 2.8, "duration": 3.36}, {"text":
