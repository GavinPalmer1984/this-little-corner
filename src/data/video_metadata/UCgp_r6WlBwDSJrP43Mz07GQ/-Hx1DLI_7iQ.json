 "description": "Jeremy and Karen discuss the concept of zero as a number, its history, its impact on science and technology,  and its implications for deeper meaning.\n\nApologies that my set up somehow didn't pivot between speakers, but I'm posting this because I believe the content is so valuable and could never be recreated. The second half is especially moving.  Jeremy gives one of the best explanations of the meaning of the Cross, the Savior and Redeemer.",
