 "description": "*Discussion with Travis Woyen, techie and musician on the evolution of language, Free Will and Free Won't, the nature of reality, the inversion of morality\n*Thucydides quoted by Owen Barfield, \"When any significant change takes place in the moral standards of a community, it will generally be seen in the shifting of the meanings of common words.\"\n*Notes on conversation:\nMark Rothko on using art to express deep emotion\nThe seed of the creative idea \"just shows up\"\nThe creative process requires integrating acquired knowledge by applying the skill to the work.  Deep learning can take place with the physical movement that creates muscle memory.\nMusic, wave theory\nOwen Barfield on language\nWords as containers of meaning\nWhat is belief?\n*Best Links for Travis' music:\nFacebook\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/traviswoyenmusic/\u00a0\u00a0\nCD Baby\u00a0https://store.cdbaby.com/Artist/TravisWoyen\u00a0\nYouTube\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6sTf5I1_5VP3fQ1dke7WdQ\nTravis Woyen music youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mUXFA-7qaAU2tRINSG7TMFPtOm-rny-Eg\n*The Heidelberg disputation:\nhttp://bookofconcord.org/heidelberg.php\n*Dr. Sharon Glotzer on Entropy, Information and Order in Soft Matter:\nhttps://youtu.be/et5KcmdCXRk\n\nComment from Travis on creativity:  \"There's always that point where I reach the fine line between \"there's really\u00a0something to this\" and \"this might be horrible\". I'm almost allergic to \"fine\", kind of like \"if you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth.\" One thing that I think is a pretty distinct difference between graphic and musical arts is that there's sort of a different \"threshing floor\" for sorting the wheat from the chaff idea-wise. I can get an idea for a piece of music and not even fix it in any way. I let it run on the \"brainio\" for a while, and if it gets lost in there, then it wasn't strong enough to survive the slew of other thoughts that happen during a day. If it survives, then it makes it to the next stage where I start working with it.\"",
