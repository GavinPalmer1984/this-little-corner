 "description": "Michael and I continue on with our discussion of Part 2 of the summary of Radical Orthodoxy, from the ideas of John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock.  Resources from our discussion follow.\n\nDocument on Radical Orthodoxy can be found here:  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sea...\n\nParadox and Participation, especially 33:00 and ff. https://youtu.be/7altNtdQly8?t=1984\n\nRobert Jenson lecture:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5inU...\n\nRobert Jenson article, How the World Lost its Story:\nhttps://www.firstthings.com/article/2...\n\nDavid Bentley Hart article about Robert Jenson\nThe Lively God of Robert Jenson\nhttps://www.firstthings.com/article/2...\n\nNOTES from the conversation:\n#3 from What is Radical Orthodoxy? by John Milbank\n\"To this traditional understanding it adds a specifically more modern view that the realm of culture, language, history and our technological interactions with nature also belongs to this participatory ascent. The realm created by human beings is not incidental to the truth, nor is it a barrier against it. Human poses participates in the divine \"verbum\", the Son of God. Likewise human social exchanges participate in the divine \"donum\", the Holy Spirit. Through both these processes, nature also comes more fully to herself.\"\n\nMichael asks, \"why is it that God has chosen to leave Himself out of the frame, most of the time?\" The church fathers had a much fuller view of salvation, the unification of heaven and earth, the deification of the entire cosmos. The cosmos is intimately connected to the Logos.\n\nBy and through Him, everything was created. And in Him, all things hold together. And in the midst of this there is the Incarnation.\n\nGod commands and by some decentralized process, things come forth. Multiplicity develops within that category.\n\n\"Is technology morally neutral, or does it have a bent towards something evil?\"  Does it contribute to the participatory ascent back towards God?\nWhy is it hard to believe that the technological process might be a good thing? Do we naturally tend towards conspiracy theories that exaggerate everything to the worst case? \n\nConspiracy theories arise because of a breakdown in trust of hierarchical organizations, and also our desire for efficiency.\n\nTo what extent is Context involved in culture, language, history, technological interactions with nature and how they interact with each other on a civilizational scale, as well as a human scale? And maybe even on the particle scale.\n\nWe lean on science because of a desire to know and also a desire to control.\n\nHierarchies exist to deal with the frame problem. \n\nSarah Coakley is an analytic theologian working towards a greater degree of precision  in the language of theology. One of the problems that arises in trying to become precise in theology is that you have to have a mystery card and you must know when to play it.\n\nRationality always deconstructs itself. It has to be nested in a priori structures of value and what is better, which can't be justified by rationality.\n\nReligion is a way of condensing the highest level representations of reality into modes of communication that can be reliably transmitted to each other both in a social context but then historically through time.\n\nCompression to make it transmissible enough is going to play havoc with that accuracy of pointing towards what you want it to point to.\nThe evangelical church may have overdone the compression, simplified it to the point that it no longer communicates what it needs to communicate.\n\nFather, Son, Holy Spirit, not Father, Son, Holy Scriptures.\n\nNext talk will be a detour to discuss Sarah Coakley's work.",
