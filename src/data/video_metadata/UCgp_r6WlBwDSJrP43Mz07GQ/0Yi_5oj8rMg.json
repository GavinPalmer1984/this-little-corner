 "description": "Karen has a conversation with John Crosby, interim pastor at Menlo Church in Menlo Park, California.  His path to faith ran through atheism to philosophy (blessed to be a student of the great Arthur Holmes). He distinguishes between the mode of philosopher and the mode of pastor. The pastor takes these important ideas and makes them accessible for life where it is lived in the trenches. \n\nHis description of the impact of the resurrection is one for the ages.\n\nHere's John's message on The Life of the Mind:  https://youtu.be/vFzcQ_n4PVw\n\nHere's a study guide from John's message on The Life of the Mind:\nhttps://d279tnhwytxyt3.cloudfront.net/SSG10.24.2021.pdf?mtime=20211022084345\n\nHere's a link to the conversation with Matt Stephan that we mentioned:\nhttps://youtu.be/-RBkoXrpqwU\n\nI also realized I didn\u2019t share the most important part of cleaning the room, which is learning that we don\u2019t have the answers. That\u2019s why everyone is looking for a church.",
