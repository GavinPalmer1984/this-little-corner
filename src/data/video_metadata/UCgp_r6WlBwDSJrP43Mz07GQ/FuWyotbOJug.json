 "description": "Karen, Michael and Nate discuss #6 in the list of principles of Radical Orthodoxy, regarding whether or not there is a nullity at the center and what is the role of suffering and love. Random ideas that were generated during the making of this video:\n\nIf everything is matter without form, you have a fundamental sameness.\nIt must be matter and form.\nIt is through the world of sensible things that we have the opportunity to see beauty.\nAny act of creation involves a pouring out of self. \nWhat principle do we use to judge a script? or a novel? How much is the author sacrificing of himself to give the character a modicum of free will?\nSophia, Wisdom, the world of divine ideas - so beautiful, and yet we risk floating off into space if we are always just up in our heads.\nSt. Augustine wrote in de Musica of participation and relationally.\n\nProgressivism seeks a progress without cost, but Reality has a real cost at every moment.\nBody is important, in one sense, because it amplifies risk.\nThe focus on beauty without a realization of its transcendence becomes an idol rather than an icon, a self-referential system, a closed system, rather than a portal through which we can see the transcendent.\nIt is the non-identical repetition that interrupts the self-referential cycle.\nIs it a beauty you want to possess? Or one you want to come into union with?\nIs it better to be good and look bad or to be bad and look good?\nModernism arises out of a necrophobia that ultimately ends in necrophilia.\nAvoiding death ends up celebrating death.\nTurning the person into an object, which is what happens in modernity and postmodernity, makes of us exactly what we make of a butterfly when we pin it to a board so that it can be analyzed, dissected .\nThe minute you conceive of cogito ergo sum, you are like that static butterfly on the board. You are so much more than the working of your mind. You are the sum total of all of your experiences and of all of your relationships and of all of your hopes and dreams. \nIdentity politics and intersectionality, or any incomplete ideology, really, is an attempt to fix you eat a particular point in time without regard to who you have been through the past and in this moment and into the future, the sins you will commit, the errors you will make, the collisions with reality, all of which will be met with God's plan to bring good out of your error.\nWe must live our faith in each moment with a proper aim as we enter into real relationships, conflicts, difficulties etc. For that is how we become an icon rather than a static idol, one in whom Christ can be seen.\n\nResources discussed:\nD C Schindler video on Beauty and Love:\nhttps://youtu.be/ei6eRK28oac?t=1480\nJordan Peterson/ Iain McGilchrist video link to 21:45, his intimations about death and suffering and the role it plays in our lives:\nhttps://youtu.be/xtf4FDlpPZ8?t=1305",
