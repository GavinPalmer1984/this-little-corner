There he was given a strange gift by a work colleague - a set of rare earth magnets. This started him on \na 26 year journey to try to understand how the world works.\nHow do we update when we encounter anomaly?\nThe rare earth magnets led him to conceptualize a Curie point heat engine that could manipulate the magnetic fields between 2 objects.\n\nThen, an existential crisis, when he had to leave the farm, and he and his family subsequently moved to Australia, Tasmania specifically. There, he encountered even more synchronicities, each one leading him closer to his idea.\n\nIn Australia, since he couldn't find work as an engineer, he started a brick and cinder block business, but after the economic crash, it fizzled. Meanwhile, his wife had become an office manager for an AC/Heat pump company, and Jason had the opportunity to become a salesman, whereupon he got an idea for a mechanism to improve efficiency and patented it. At age 49, he had the opportunity to retrain as a refrigeration mechanic which provided more pieces of the puzzle, how to turn Mount Everest upside down with no energy input required.\nBased on the lapse rate, the reduction in temperature with altitude, the linear movement of air through the atmosphere, and the fact that cold water sinks and warm water rises. Governed by the ideal gas laws.\n\nCALLING ALL ENGINEERS!\n\nA few questions still need to be resolved. \nHeat at the top is needed to create the updraft to pull the air upward. How much heat? Can it be produced simply with ambient heat that is already available so that no additional energy input is needed? And how far down from the top of the column do you have to put the heat exchanger?\nGiven the rise rate, how much energy will actually be produced and what would be the payback period for the initial capital expenditure?\n\nA search showed that there is currently a somewhat similar energy production system, the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion in Hawaii, but this is being done with ocean water.\nJason\u2019s idea could be done in the desert and actually also produce a side benefit of condensate water in abundance, producing an oasis in the Sahara. \n\nOr, the columns could provide the central portion of a kilometer high building in Dubai and would produce all the necessary energy and water for the residents of the building.\n\nIt could also be used to improve the efficiencies of coal-fired plants.\nThe rise rate determines the power output. Numbers still have to be crunched.\n\nThis would be 24/7 renewable energy, not dependent on the sun or on the outside temperature, dependent only on the rise rate.\n\nInverting the thermal profile of the atmosphere. Taking the ambient ground level heat and taking it one kilometer closer to where it wants to go. Trying to use a resource that has not been tapped.\nCurrent plans are for concrete base and steel columns, but could fairly rapidly move to carbon fibre, as carbon fibre becomes more economically feasible. It is now being used for Boeing 707.\n\nImmense gratitude for all of the synchronicities that led to the idea, and the humility to realize what he doesn\u2019t know and to want to offer the idea freely to the world.\n\nResources:\nEsther Lightcap Meek and Brent Lonergan on Covenantal Knowing\n  Longing to Know, Loving to Know are her two books.\nN.
