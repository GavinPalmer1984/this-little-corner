 "description": "Jeremy, newly baptized into the Eastern Orthodox Church along with his family,  discusses the metaphor of entropy at the social level. \nPredictability has its good sides and its bad sides, as does unpredictability.\nParticipation is necessary for healing.\nThe way to transcend your suffering is to sacrifice it to a higher identity.\n\nThe depth of meaning in words like authority and obedience, Identity and communion, inclusion and exclusion, attention and rationality.\n\nTake responsibility - heal - repent - participate. \n\nPrevious conversations with Jeremy:\nHis story: https://youtu.be/0rX19eXPSRc\nOn the Two Great Commandments:  https://youtu.be/6IfWU3zQRjI\nOn fatherhood:  https://youtu.be/1zAcaxJhG9o",
