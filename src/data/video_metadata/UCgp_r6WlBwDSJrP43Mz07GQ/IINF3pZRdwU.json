In this episode, we touch on entropy and  theory of computation,\n\nIntro to Theory of Computation link: https://youtu.be/58N2N7zJGrQ?t=466\nMisunderstood Nature of Entropy link: https://youtu.be/kfffy12uQ7g?t=140\nDigital Smell video link on key in lock mechanism in neurons: https://youtu.be/NsqsEni2uE4?t=3284\n\nGetting Entropy right is important\nIntelligence as a modifier:  intelligently behaved systems, systems that demonstrate intelligence, acting intelligently.\nSimplest computational structure - a state machine\nThe universe of keys is the universe of consciousness of the lock.\nWhat information is useful to you.\nThe key has a profile. The lock mechanism has a model of what it's looking for.  The computation is comparing the model with the key.\nDance is an example of a learning that has been incorporated into your fabric where you no longer have to think about it.\nThe correspondence between the mechanical side and a language.\nUsing a language like Verilog, an abstract idea can be turned into traces on a silicon disc and instantiated in the real world.\nThe theory of computation - abstract half and physical half.\nSet theory. Computational systems and a hierarchy of languages.\nThe system recognizes a language.\nHow do we get to an artificial non-biological life form? \n1. Cast it into the language of computation and it will tell you what the structure will look like?\n2. Self-sustaining (harvests energy, feeds itself)\n3. Be able to reproduce.\n4. Find a chemical that acts as a logic switch. \nUsing proteins as a logic gate? Life happens because proteins can fold in a certain way.\nRNA polymerase transcribes the DNA. The protein molecule is built intelligently.\n\nNext episode we will discuss Emergence.\nAlso the possible combinations of deterministic and predictable, unpredictable, indeterministic.\nDNA is encoded information. If something is using the information, the system defines what is useful.\n\nWhole 6 part series Playlist:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoARw9zo4EUZhxqfaqYU5yjy0-Tr8RlB4", "duration": 3661,
