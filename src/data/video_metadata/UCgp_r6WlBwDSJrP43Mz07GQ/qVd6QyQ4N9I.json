My apologies, it gets cut off rather abruptly due to technical difficulties. To hear the rest of the discussion, here is the link to Part 2:  https://youtu.be/bEYnlIqaGh4\n\nAlso I mentioned the YouTube channel, The Anadromist, and his publishing of the lectures by Hans Rookmaaker. Here is a lecture on art.  https://youtu.be/zSdYF__ZWt4\n\nIn Part 2, linked above, we move on to the trajectory of philosophy since the Enlightenment and how the loss of enchantment has narrowed the frame for those who are seeking truth, especially how those trapped in a scientific reductionist frame have nowhere to look for the source of consciousness than a kind of pan psychism or panentheism. What did the Middle Ages have to say about that line of belief?\n\nIntro to Nancy Pearcey:\nNancy Pearcey is the author of Love Thy Body: Answering Hard Questions about Life and Sexuality. Her earlier books include The Soul of Science, Saving Leonardo, Finding Truth, and two ECPA Gold Medallion Award Winners: How Now Shall We Live (coauthored with Harold Fickett and Chuck Colson) and Total Truth. Her books have been translated into 12 languages. She is professor and scholar in residence at Houston Baptist University. A former agnostic, Pearcey has spoken at universities such as Princeton, Stanford, USC, and Dartmouth. She was highlighted as one of the five top women apologists by Christianity Today and was hailed in The Economist as \"America's pre-eminent evangelical Protestant female intellectual.\"\nLink to
