Links to videos we discussed follow the notes.\n\u201cOne of the privileges of the great is to witness catastrophes from a terrace.\u201d  Jean Giraudoux\n\nWhile teaching ethics to undergrads at Oxford Paula was trying to find a way to encourage her students to apply ethics to real life as their examples are often too narrow. So she took a class in illustration to find a way to illustrate some of the more difficult ideas into more accessible bites. she shows an accordion book she made of a quote from Descartes. \n\nShe also offers a different way of looking at AI by using photographs that push us out of our preconceptions to see in a new way.\n\nNot so much whether AI will some day control us but to take a look at the ways it already controls us.\n\nPaula also recommends doing life sketching and travel sketching as a way of making memories more real and tangible, and also a way of being more in the moment.\n\n\"It's a privilege of the great to witness catastrophes from a terrace.\"\n\nRe: the MIT Media Labs' Moral Machines Experiment, Paul referenced Philippa Foot who was the originator of the trolley problem. Philippa was also friends with Elizabeth Anscombe and Iris Murdoch.\n\nNot so much whether AI can be more creative than we are, but to take a look at the way AI technology is already crushing the creativity out of us.\n\nThe previous conversation with Paula where she told her life story:\nhttps://youtu.be/7-wjItDcMCU\n\nThe Ted Talk on AI and Creativity: https://youtu.be/LzsjORsPTfU\n\nIris
