There\u2019s a revelation in it.\nThe epiphany gives you another way to look at the situation.\n\nLaughter is an affection\nImmanuel Kant quote\u2026 \u201cIn everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must be something absurd (in which the understanding, therefore, can find no satisfaction). Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing.\u201d\n\nMazeltopf - may you have good flow.\n\nHumor is an analog of divinity, from higher to lower - there\u2019s always a reversal.\nWhen a baby is born, everything that is closed opens. Everything that is open closes.\nYou are in the terrain of the sacred. It can take you amazing places or to places of degradation.\n\nIn the beginning, God\u2026\nWith every new creation, you have a new mask of nature. We have to puncture the veil of the mask of nature in order to get a glimpse of God. He conceals Himself because if we could see Him straight on, we would be blinded by His glory.\n\nMary Tyler Moore Show\nMary Richards is the one everyone wants to be. Phyllis is the one no one wants to be.\nRhoda os the one we probably are.\n\nThe door of paradox is the door of the divine. A good writer peppers his script with dichotomies.\nThe polarity is the unified divine spark.\n\nTiming is the pregnant pause - dosing out a little bit of nothing before something arrives.\n\nA joke is a reversal. First it goes up and then goes down or vice versa. Plus one to minus one which brings us back to nothing.\n\nEmily Dickinson poem, Tell All the Truth.\nhttps://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56824/tell-all-the-truth-but-tell-it-slant-1263\n\nJonathan
