Berkeley in Engineering Physics) and Ira (U. Of Florida in Mechanical Engineeringand Masters at Duke in Fluid Mechanics) discuss the meaning crisis and what Austrian Economics might offer in terms of answers.\n\nEngineering looks at how things work. \nIra initially became interested in Austrian Economics through reading Ludwig Von Mises\u2019 Human Action. Karl first read Friedrich Hayek and then found his way to Von Mises.\nThe free market system to some extent depends upon a moral people, a sense of the dignity and value of other individuals.\nSince the resurrection of Jesus Christ, this idea of the value and dignity of each and every. Individual has percolated through history - had a great impact on the enlightenment.\nThe practice of agape bears much fruit.\nThe Foundation for Economic Education (https://fee.org)\n\nBooks and authors mentioned:\nLudwig Von Mises - Human Action\nFriedrich Hayek - The Road to Serfdom\nGad Saad\nNassim Taleb\nSam Harris\nStephen Pinker\nJordan Peterson\nMurray Rothbard", "duration": 4112,
