These are the verses that he feels point to the Cosmic nature of Christ.\n\nHebrews 1:1-3\nGod...in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, home He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the world. And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the Word of His power.\n\nCol 1:16-17\nFor by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities - all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.\n\nRom 11:33-36\nOh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor? Or who has first given to Him that it would be paid back to him. For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.\n\nJohn 1:1-4\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. \n\nText from Jordan Peterson clip:\nLife is suffering\nLove is the desire to ameliorate suffering\nTruth is the handmaiden of Love.\nDialogue is the pathway to Truth.\nHumility is the recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn.\nTo learn is to die voluntarily and to be born again in great ways and small.\nSpeech must be untrammeled\nso that dialog can take place\nso that we can humbly learn\nso that Truth can serve Love\nso that suffering can be ameliorated\nso that e can all stumble forward towards the kingdom of God.\n\nMatt Stephan, Pastor the San Mateo Campus of Menlo Church,\nSan Mateo, CA\nmenlo.church\n\nMatt's message on conspiracy theories starts at 20:50\nhttps://youtu.be/c33eBM7OxY0\n\nThese are good videos to get a grip on Jordan Peterson:\nThe lecture at Linfield College that includes the line: Truth is the handmaiden of Lovehttps://youtu.be/AKHuxVvA7T8?t=1188\n\nThe first of the Biblical Series -basically lays out where he's going:https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\n\nThis is the last of the Biblical Series, very interesting because he starts with a summary of what has gone before,so instead of listening to 45 hours, you can listen to this one 3 hour lecture and get a good idea of his perspective.https://youtu.be/B7V8eZ1BLiI", "duration": 2729, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "today i'm really
