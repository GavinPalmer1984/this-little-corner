 "description": "Saving the Appearances by Owen Barfield\nLoving to Know by N. T. Wright\n\nCormack McCarthy\nRene Girard\nMichael Polanyi\nEsther Meek\nDrew Johnson\nNeil Postman\n\nThe growth of technology had all the promise of a shining city on a hill via the democratization of power by engaging a special kind of truth telling by the Amateur.\n\nAmateurs needed ingenuity and ability to participate, produced open source software that forms the foundation of Google, Facebook, other tech giants, providing an organized structure, and it also created the ability to harness language in a new way, both human language and technical language.\n\nThe internet has the potential to become a totalizing system as it leans toward a monopoly and totalitarian control. Ecosystems need diversity and harmonious interactions in order to thrive, but if you impose a system from without, you can completely destroy the naturally functioning biosystem.\n\nThis disrupts the balance of chaos and order. Barfield, Saving the Appearancees: there is a danger for language to become so particularized for certain arenas that you can guarantee that this area gets ensconced in negative order. It becomes so complexities that no single individual can make sense of the whole thing.\n\nThe internet has also made a business out of channeling people\u2019s energies into non-productive pursuits, dampening the spark that comes from individuals that is needed to continuously reinsert new life into the rigidity of the current order.\n\nThe meaning doesn\u2019t live in the individual pieces or individual people, but in the relationships and interactions among the pieces (people)\n\nWith software, failure and success are visible. You think you understand something, create a software program for it, but you will know right away whether you actually understood it, based on whether or not the program works.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to live in deception, but are often self-deceived. The effectiveness of any lie depends on the extent to which I myself believe the lie.\n\nDoes technology allow us to lie more easily, to manipulate our environment? \n\nWhat are our desired ends? We have to hold them in a knowing/unknowing way. It\u2019s not good to have them too tightly mapped. Technology tends to do things in a very prescribed way.\nRene Girard: The one who sacrifices is the hero. The antagonist is the one unwilling to sacrifice but who manipulates the world to their own ends. \u201cAnything that exists outside my knowledge exists without my consent.\u201d \n\nThere is a complexity that is hidden with the lie. We deceive ourselves by thinking, \u201cI can deceive, and the deception that I have introduced into the fabric of reality won\u2019t affect me.\u201d But the lie you tell today, necessitates a million lies in the future. \n\nJordan Peterson, \u201cTell the truth, or at least, don\u2019t lie.\u201d The Truth is an infinite gleaming Reality, but we as individuals are filled with implicit biases that prevent us from ever telling the absolute Truth. We can, however, avoid the conscious lie, and every time we do so, our true motivation becomes more apparent to us and we can course correct.\n\nRupert Sheldrake and his idea of morphic shields, the spiritual habits of the collective unconscious. Michael Polanyi, Esther Meek and Drew Johnson with the idea of subsidiary focal integration by which we learn habits, build neural pathways forming most of what we do every day.\n\nThe interaction between habit and memory makes its way into technology. Some lies get built right in, codified - too difficult to go back and fix them, so we just keep moving forward, molding ourselves to adapt to the concrete mistakes built into the system rather than having the system mold to us.\n\nNeil Postman talks about the mechanistic assumptions about the nature of reality which have colonized our consciousness to a large degree.\n\nDifferences between Abstraction and Mystery\n\nAbstraction is a way of hiding complexity which is necessary so that we don\u2019t become overloaded with all the details. A human being s a story, a kind of abstraction. We consist of all of our relationships with the world and with others, but the more successful we are with abstraction, the more disconnected from others we become.\n\nMystery is a different way of being in the world, not knowable in a concrete way.\nSt. Gregory of Nissa: \"Salvation is a way of moving from having to being.\"\nTo articulate the feminine is to undo it. \n\nAn icon is a portal onto something that is infinitely complex.\n\nN. T. Wright, Loving to Know. Michael relates that there are many layers of love. At the top, a change takes place between the Lover and the Loved. You can\u2019t know a thing without it deforming you. When you take in the new knowledge, your old model of the thing cannot exist anymore, so you care in a constant state of deforming, then reforming, if you are always open to new knowledge.\n\nLuke wraps up with a picture of the utterly compelling, winsome, hard but tender and non-coercive love of the Lord Jesus Christ.",
