 "description": "Michael and I continue on with our discussion of Part 2 of the summary of Radical Orthodoxy, from the ideas of John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock.  Resources from our discussion follow.\n\nDocument on Radical Orthodoxy can be found here:  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/mleighty%40gmail.com?projector=1\n\nParadox and Participation, especially 33:00 and ff. https://youtu.be/7altNtdQly8?t=1984\n\nRobert Jenson lecture:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5inULwpiJY&feature=emb_logo\n\nRobert Jenson article, How the World Lost its Story:\nhttps://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/03/how-the-world-lost-its-story\n\nDavid Bentley Hart article about Robert Jenson\nThe Lively God of Robert Jenson\nhttps://www.firstthings.com/article/2005/10/the-lively-god-of-robert-jenson\n\nNOTES from the conversation:\n\nRadical Orthodoxy attempts to bridge two extremes\nThe ancient idea of participation - via grace disclosing itself to us.\nThe attempt to come to the unity of knowledge and revelation without throwing away the good of what we've learned in modernity.\nSalvation is not just an ark of safety but an actual unification with the Divine.\nThe mystery of unification in the sense that we divide in order to come back together.\nThe unexpected gift of post modernism in exposing the division as it increases our desire for unity.\nThe unity is not a one off - no before and no after - but rather the eternal oneness, the lamb slain before the foundation of the world who is also revealed to be the culmination.\nNot only to save people, but the cosmos itself\n\"The door to hell is locked from the inside.\" The question becomes \"Is my will strong enough to forever lock that door?\"\nThe church is a vessel of salvation for ourselves and for others,\nmoving through Time.\nGod has created myriads of mediating structures to Himself.\nTime is simultaneously a cyclical thing and a movement upwards.\nAll the beauty, glory and splendor of God is an event - Christ.\nMetaphysics is connected to narrative. God lives with us into the future.\nStory and Promise.\nEvery decisive event is unpredictable until it happens, then it becomes inevitable, and thus plays a chiastic role.\nThe paradox of the Father's eternal sacrifice in creation versus His impassibility.\n\nhypostasis\nGiving substance of reality to the Lord's guarantee to fulfill the faith He in births.\nChrist is the exact representation of His nature, the exact expression of His substance.\nA setting or placing under - the thing put under - the substructure - the foundation.\n\nThat which has a foundation, that which has actual existence, substance, real being.\nThe substantial quality or nature of a person or thing.\nHupostasis also has the meaning of confidence, assurance.\n\nMetecho - to partake of, to participate, to belong to, to be in union with\n\nHebrew 2:14\n\nHope drives action, motivates it, reveals the promise of the future, the golden thread, while Faith acts to bring it about.",
