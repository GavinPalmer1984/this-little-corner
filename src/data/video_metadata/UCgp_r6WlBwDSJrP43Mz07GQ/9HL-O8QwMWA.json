Where is God in this moment. There is this space and it\u2019s covering the whole globe. In this space something is happening, much of which we can approach with gratitude. The same picture as the picture of this conversation. \n\nFist shaking gets you nowhere\nPity party gets you nowhere\n\nI\u2019m here, maybe I can\u2019t be thankful, but I can be thankful for what comes out of it. \n\nAnomaly, the stumbling stone, the falling into chaos\n\nGo voluntarily into the chaos to find the treasures. \n\nLet\u2019s go treasure hunting! \n\nExpansion in the definition of what we think of as Christian\n\nDavid Bentley Hart\u2019s recent book\n\nClick here to meetup with other viewers of Paul's channel for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
