Karen is not so sure.\n\nWe reference Paul VanderKlay's video with John Vervaeke which posits God as the ancient solution to the frame problem. https://youtu.be/BqinRbjqy2c\n\nWhat is nature? What is grace? What has changed? Our ability to perceive.\n\nChallenges are opportunities to see grace in action.\n\nFear - of losing ourselves, of losing our possessions.  Remember that everything is given to us as a gift.\n\nWe now have better quantitative measures of the extent of our ignorance and yet, the heart has not produced humility.\n\nWe have lost the sense of wonder of the first humans looking at the night sky.\n\nI highly recommend following Nancy Hillis who writes \nthe artist's blog that references constraint satisfaction and optimization.\nIn each blog post, she discusses art, psychology and science.\nhttps://www.artistsjourney.com/creativity-complexity-search-for-resolution\n\nThe Daily Office app to which Michael referred:
