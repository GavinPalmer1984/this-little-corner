All faith is based on evidence.\nMany New Atheists now promote the idea that free will does not exist. Perhaps believing in a deterministic universe absolves one of the necessity or obligation of responsibility to the Source of our free will.\nThe possibility of determinism and the purely materialist world view died with the understanding of quantum mechanics, since we know now that the quantum world is purely stochastic.\nFilled with gratitude for the Holy Spirit's patience and mercy and grace.\nThe Works of His Hands: A Scientist's Journey from Atheism to Faith\nLearn more: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0825446074/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_dVZTDb\nQ2J3R2B\nSy's favorite hymns are Amazing
