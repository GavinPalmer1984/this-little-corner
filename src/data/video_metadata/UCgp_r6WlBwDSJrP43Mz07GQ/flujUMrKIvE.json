The name of the letter as well as the sound represents a concept. It is a meaningful language.\nThe consonants that represent Pestilence can be placed with different vowels and that would create three different words/meanings. Those 3 words are Dever (pestilence), Davar (thing/the material world), \nDeebare (speech).\nIn Hebrew, a word and the thing itself are the same thing.\nWe are made in the image of God and God speaks the world into being.\nWhen God blows into the nose of Adam, He is purveying the capacity for speech. The breath is the speech.\nDo words matter? Are words matter? If words don't matter, what matters?\nSecular v. spiritual mentality - words are things and they're kept fresh by how we speak them, and in this way, we keep the material world fresh.\nIn recent decades, our speech has become eroded.\nOld proverb: He who is kind when he should be cruel will be\ncruel when he should be kind. Miriam was quarantined because of how she spoke about Moses. We have begun to use empty speech for all forms of expression, even intimacy. Empty speech - fake experts.\nBut Jordan Peterson came on to the scene and for two years taught us what speech can be. Choose your words. You can make them a banquet or you can let them be nothing more than crumbs.\nSpeech has been so degraded, crudities spewing out of their mouths.\nAnd now, we have become concerned with what else is spewing out of people's mouths. We are wearing face masks to protect us from what is pouring out of the mouths of others.\nBy learning hypnosis, Ms. Poizner became imprinted with the verbal style of the practitioner who trained her. By hemming yourself in, by sacrifice and self-discipline, you are clearing your channel and making space for creativity.\nLet's clear the air. We've cleaned our rooms. Let's clean our speech.\nNot just precision of speech, but purity of speech. Gratitude, elevated speech.\nThe search for self:\nInner v. outer\nYin v. Yang\nThese must be balanced\nThose who get sick are those whose inner and outer are not balanced, where there is a rift creating a capacity for invasion.\nOld Jewish saying:  God creates the cure before he creates the illness.\nChaos v. Order\nRight Brain v. Left Brain\nAffiliation v. inhibition\nAttraction v. Retraction\nWe need both sides to achieve mastery\nWhat confounds the map of reality? What is the psychologicall significance\n of the God ideal? What is the meta map of reality?\nNot a world of things but a world of values.\nthe Kabbalah looks for clues in Hebrew words to find intrinsic patterns to find the unity.\nWe recalibrate. A system of character refinement.\n\nhttps://karenwongart.com", "duration": 4189, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "so I'm here today with Annette poisoner", "start": 1.61, "duration": 6.67}, {"text":
