That makes your every smile or helping hand change something important in the world, and you start seeing positive feedback loops.\n\u201cPick an ideal and aim at it\u201d You need to chase after something, and need something chasing you.\nLoves the Bay Area and Santa Cruz and the ocean. Probably not going back to Kansas.\nEnjoying the Jordan Peterson meetup.", "duration": 3220, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hi this is Karen Wong at the meaning", "start": 1.19, "duration": 6.16},
