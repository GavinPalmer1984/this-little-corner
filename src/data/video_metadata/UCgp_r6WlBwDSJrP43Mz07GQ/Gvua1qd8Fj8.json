Sam's side had some sound problems, but if you are patient, you will be rewarded by his rich and poetic thoughts.\n\nSam Glenn asked if I'd appear on his channel to talk about our internet space and to discuss his dissertation on Love. Along the way, we bring in Plato, Plotinus, Aristotle, David Bohm, Erich Fromm, and we discuss desire, delight and sacrifice.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next conversation with Sam when he appears on the Meaning Code in the New Year.\n\nHere's the video of D C Schindler we discussed on Beauty and Love.\nThe sound is better on this video but the other one is more complete in terms of Schindler's thought.  https://youtu.be/b26vvB3-97g\n\nHere's the one with the poor sound, but the depth of meaning.\nhttps://youtu.be/ei6eRK28oac\n\nA visual summary of Stephen Wolfram's theory of everything (you can find everything about it at https://wolframphysics.org\nhttps://www.wolframphysics.org/visual-summary/\n\nHere are the videos of Stephen Wolfram's theory of everything.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoARw9zo4EUZtF8ldv2sK2AEWlRfwalgS\n\nLove v.
