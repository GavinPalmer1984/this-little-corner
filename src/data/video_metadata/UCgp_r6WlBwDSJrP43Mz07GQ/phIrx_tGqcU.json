Yes. But that could equally well be argued for socialism. \n\nIn studying human action, you are studying laws that govern reality. \nSociety works to produce things. Gravity exists. These are fundamentals of reality. True fundamental economic reality is aligned with the way the world works. You can change your economic theories, but any theory that does not align with reality will have negative consequences over time.\n\nTo make things more efficient and produce what people value requires information and the best way to get this information is through the price structure.\nContrasting the subjective theory of value with the labor theory of value.\nMud pies and techie's esoteric ideas. Many hours of labor, but if no consumer wants them, they have no value.\n\nAdvertising propaganda manipulates people, but politics also uses propaganda. At least, as a consumer, you can try a product and if you don't like it, you can try another.\n\nFree market distributes power rather than concentrating it.\n\nThe consumer society can't be laid at the feet of capitalism. It is a meaning crisis issue. How you use the extra wealth the free market brings you is up to you. Fix the meaning crisis and people will make different choices.\n\nProblems arise as organizations grow. Large government organizations are even worse than large corporations.\n\n With proper meaning, free markets will work. Without addressing the meaning crisis, we may not be headed to a good place.\n\nIn smaller organizations, the business entities have to answer to consumers but the larger they grow, this no longer holds true to the same extent. Political power, however, does have to answer to the voters. The problems are exacerbated when corporations grow large enough to control political entities. Parasitic. Either cronyism or the government taking the people's wealth and using it for what the government values rather than what the people value.\n\nWhere do ideas come from? Ideas have consequences. People don't have ideas. Ideas have people.These controlling ideas can move a society in bad directions.\n\nUsing the lens of gratitude and empathy to look at the past helps us navigate the combinatorial explosion that is the infinite array of facts about any time period.\n\nHow did big corporations take over the world? The myth of the railroad trust and the myth of the power of OPEC. The mechanism that enabled the Federal Reserve, the health care industry's incestuous relationship with government, the relationship between regulatory agencies and monopoly power.\n\nGovernment power interferes with the natural tendency of large sluggish corporations to fail.\n\nSolve the meaning crisis. Hope. Courage. Prayer\n\nSome additional resources from Ira:\nCorbett Report  https://www.corbettreport.com/ \n \nOne example of Silicon
