https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Brain-Search-Meaning-ebook/dp/B008JE7I2M\nJeremy Firth YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/jeremyfirth\nPaul\u2019s marriage video with Guy Sengstock:  https://youtu.be/qMyACsMlNMs\nKaren Wong\u2019s websites:  \nhttps://TheMeaningCode.com, \nhttps://karenwongart.com\n\nJeremy came to faith after time as an agnostic.\nLooking for a balance in the binaries:\nClassical (systems oriented) + Romantic (aesthetic)\nL Hemisphere + R Hemisphere\nFrame + Dust\nRecipe + Flour\nIntentions (heaven) + Material (earth)\n\nGrowing up in a chaotic household led to building a buffer from comedy or intellect.\nComedy framework;\nFirst a proposition, then something matches the pattern, then something breaks the pattern\nAdapting to anomaly updates the prediction model.\n\nWe are a complex system within complex systems\nHard to draw a boundary around a person.\nDrawing a boundary both separates a thing from other things, and unites a thing with itself,\nGives it a purpose, a telos\nBecause of Jordan Peterson, it\u2019s a distributed problem that we are all working on.\nWe are the Tribe of No Tribe.\nNot a book waiting to be written but a movement ready to take place.\n\nTechnology both enables/empowers us (good) and makes us more dependent/vulnerable (bad)\nHappy and complete is not the goal.\n\nSelf-educated\nGot interested in chaos theory because of his role in manufacturing.\nWorks at a custom fabrication shop, a one off, unique design.\nChaos theory is theoretically deterministic but has too many variables to be functionally predictive and is sensitive to initial conditions.\nComplexity theory has feedback loops, is not sensitive to initial conditions.\n\nChaos Theory connects to fractals and to the Pareto distribution\nFractals are infinite in either direction, but the scale of the variance always stays the same.\nSo, the average is always wrong\nChaotic systems stack up to produce complex systems, feedback the results (genetic algorithms)\nTraditional statistics are based on linear algebra, but Bayesian prediction is recursive, and based on probability.\n\nJeremy is a Business Intelligence
