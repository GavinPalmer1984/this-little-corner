 "description": "Notes on the talk with Michael re Michael Polanyi and Esther Lightcap Meekwith links to pertinent videos.\n\nKnowledge v. Information\n\nJBP - A vision of the desirable future links action in the NOW w important long-term foundational values. It provides a frame limiting anxiety and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nMichael: The rationalistic frame is self-contradictory.\nBarfield - the philosophy of the arts and Polanyi - the philosophy of science\nBoth were striving to answer the question of knowing.\nMichael Polanyi - \u201cA free society that strives to be value neutral undermines its own justification. But it is not enough for the members of a free society to believe that ideals such as truth, justice and beauty, are objective. They also have to accept that they transcend our ability to wholly capture them.\u201d The objectivity of values must be combined with acceptance that all knowing is fallible.  Polanyi denied that minds are reducible to collections of rules.\n\nThe structure of Tacit Knowing. We experience the world by integrating our subsidiary awareness into a focal awareness.\n\nEsther Lightcap Meek\n\u201cKnowing is the responsible human struggle to rely on clues to focus on a coherent pattern and submit to its reality. Much of the pattern-making process is inarticulable.\nKnowing requires more than words.\n\nThe false dichotomies\nFact - Value\nReason - Faith\nMind - Body\nTheory - Application\nDefault setting due to our western view.\n\nHow do you teach a child to ride a bicycle? A new paradigm of knowing'\nMy efforts at knowing are a way of developing a relationship with that which is yet to be known.\nJBP\u2019s paradigm of known/unknown/knower\nEsther Meek:  \n\"Invite the real.\" The dance as Reality calls you forward into relationship...\n\nIf you want to know how to fly a fighter jet, you must do your time. Invest in putting yourself in a position to access the real.\n\nReality graciously self-discloses to people who put themselves in the place to see it, to invest that time.\n\nKnowing God is similar to knowing your auto mechanic.\nVideos of Esther Meek\nhttps://youtu.be/wAt4epHvXQY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5fM9upsv3Pg\n\u201cHope of future possibilities testifies that you\u2019ve made contact with reality.\u201d\n\nKW:  And conversely, knowing your auto mechanic is like knowing God. This goes to JBP\u2019s art of listening, art of getting to know another person, or truly cleaning your room, or truly developing a skill.  If you truly pursue any of these things as far as you can take them, one deep symbol after another, deeply nested all the way down will begin to open up to you and also, the truth will unfold. AND you being to see yourself in a new way, recognizing your own known and unknown parts, your hamartia - that which misses the mark. \n\nBlaise Pascal - the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse, both are active, simultaneously, all the time, but the west has privileged the spirit of Geometry.\nIf you can\u2019t provide an equation for your knowledge, it will be discarded.\nMichael sees this as an outgrowth of the Reformation with the need to become more and more correct and to get things into ever smaller boxes.\n\nMichael:  Plus, when we are only taking in from the world (binging on Netflix, etc.), this hides the errors of our thinking from us. \nAs JBP says, the Transcendent reveals itself to you in error.\nSo, if we do not see our error, we will not see the Transcendent.\n\nWhen we look only at knowledge as information and neglect feelings, intuitions, emotions, perceptions, we are neglecting the fundamental issue of science.\n\u201cWhy did you become a scientist? What did you love that led you to the questions you are seeking to answer? Where does that passion come from? To be a scientist requires a love of the search. The questions bubble up from the bottom of the iceberg.\u201d  Michael\n\nFrom D. C. Schindler (Surprised by Truth), Reason leads us to surprises beyond itself. Philosophy and all knowledge begins in wonder.  The What If? At the heart of everything is some sort of mystery, our relationship to the unknown.  \nHowever, the new atheists whittle everything down into smaller and smaller boxes.\nD. C. Schindler, The Last Lecture:  https://youtu.be/JRgkRcHHQ7c\n\nIt is impossible to do any learning without humility, for if you already know all the answers, you have no relationship with the unknown.\n\nDramatic truth unfolds itself to us over time, like a story does.  The analogy here to DNA writes itself. New plot points re-inform the meaning of the story as it goes along.\nRandom is just another word for a pattern we aren\u2019t smart enough to figure out.\n\nEphesians:  God\u2019s manifold wisdom, all things will come together in Christ.\n\nGod is unchanging but that doesn\u2019t have to mean static.  Rather, unchanging can mean faithful and faithful allows for a dynamic future with an unfolding relationship.\n\nPaul Davies on The Demon in the Machine:\nhttps://youtu.be/favrMbfi1Pw",
