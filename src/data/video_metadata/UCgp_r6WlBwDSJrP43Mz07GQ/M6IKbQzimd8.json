Phenomenology as a Gateway to LaCoste.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6IKbQzimd8", "date": "2020-12-03", "description": "Matthew and I are \"noodling\" around with the ideas of Husserl, Descartes, Schleiermacher, Lacoste, Heidegger and N. T. Wright as we seek to understand the \"middle\" or \"transjective\" voice, the necessity of translation to good interrelations and the capacity to know and be known by an unseen God.\n\nMatthew has developed a new hobby in cooking and exploring the making of the perfect French sauces. He and I explore the idea of the perfect \"reduction\" and compare/contrast with the idea of reduction in terms of data compression, exclusion-inclusion and materialistic reductionism. Is there a way for the sauce to be saved? What is the function of a sauce? What is its context.  \n\nResources:\nJean LaCoste, Experience and the Absolute, the philosopher who is exploring a theological turn in phenomenology.\n\nN. T. Wright, essay called Loving to Know that appeared in the February edition of First Things.\n\nHusserl's Lectures, pp. IX to XVIII, especially
