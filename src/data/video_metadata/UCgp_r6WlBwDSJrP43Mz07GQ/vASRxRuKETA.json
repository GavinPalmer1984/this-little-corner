In the last 20 minutes or so, we get around to discussing Jordan Peterson's latest conversation with Jonathan Pageau. We invite your comments!\n\nNotable quotes from Matt:\nThe parabolic modality is a tool for evoking from people a body of knowledge that has to be articulated.\nSuffering is the accent of every moment in language that hits us. You'll eventually see a face.\nCliches are shouted. Gold is whispered.\nBring the unknown into the center of the known.\nThe fulcrum can be a controlling idea. If you have two ideas, you swing from good to bad to good. But if you have three things, then you have eternity to work with.\n\nFollow Karen on Twitter @klwong43\nhttps://karenwongart.com\nhttps://TheMeaningCode.com", "duration": 5977, "transcript_parts":
