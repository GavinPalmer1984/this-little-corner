The relationship of these events is termed \"dynamic quality\" by Pirsig. Static quality (static patterns) something that is already defined, anything that can be found in a dictionary.\n\nMore thoughts on the rat example in the discussion (the difference between the rats that \"love the lever\" and the rats that go right to where the food will be).\n\nFaith is the substance of things hoped for. We are meant to experience \"substance\", not \"substitutes\". The food is the hoped for thing. It becomes \"substance\" when it is provided by the Promiser, when the \nPromise is fulfilled, you could say, when the potential (the frame, the mesh, the matrix of possibility) is interpenetrated with the substance. The Promiser is the only one who knows when the food will actually arrive, but the addictable rats fall in love with the promise which is a poor substitute for the Promiser. The non-addictable rats trust that the Promiser will\ndeliver on the promise and provide the food. There is a verse in scripture, \"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live. It's not I, but Christ, who lives in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and died for me.\" It is by His faith that we are able to receive the \nsubstance of the thing hoped for. The poor addictable rats are sitting over there worshipping the golden calf while the rest of the Israelites are enjoying the manna from heaven (symbolically speakinig, of course, as these moments were not contemporaneous:-) Also, \"Every promise of God is 'Yes!' in Jesus Christ.\" The Promiser is greater than the promise.\n\nConversations being discussed here include:\nMark Solms on

um", "start": 163.28, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "specifically conditional relationships", "start": 165.92, "duration": 2.72}, {"text": "which means", "start": 167.76, "duration": 3.759}, {"text":

5.92}, {"text": "have played around with a lot", "start": 241.2, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "is the idea of a lock and key", "start": 243.439, "duration": 4.561}, {"text": "so the", "start": 250.159,

about that process it", "start": 289.199, "duration": 4.161}, {"text": "seems to me", "start": 292.4, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "that i mean this is what goes on in my", "start": 293.36, "duration":

to", "start": 298.8, "duration": 2.399}, {"text": "think it through", "start": 300.0, "duration": 4.479}, {"text": "so so i only have the question yeah", "start": 301.199, "duration": 6.081}, {"text": "not the answer yet but my question is", "start": 304.479, "duration": 3.201}, {"text": "then", "start": 307.28, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "couldn't we also say that", "start": 307.68, "duration":

336.56, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "the result", "start": 338.56, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "yeah that makes sense if that's true", "start": 339.6, "duration": 6.159}, {"text": "then that means that in a sense", "start": 342.72, "duration": 7.36}, {"text": "the physical laws of the universe", "start": 345.759, "duration": 4.321}, {"text": "are the conditions under which the", "start":

that's", "start": 399.12, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "what he's talking about but yeah that", "start": 401.039, "duration": 2.561}, {"text": "makes sense", "start": 402.72, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "beyond his well i think we're where i", "start": 403.6, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "think both of us have sort of um i guess", "start": 406.88, "duration": 2.879}, {"text": "what you would say",
