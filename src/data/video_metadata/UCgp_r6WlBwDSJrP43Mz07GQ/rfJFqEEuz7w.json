S. Constitution protects us from our worst impulses\nThe tyranny of the experts\nComplexity is subsidy\nNotes from Buck on the Constitution:  In terms of resources to read more about a lot of this stuff, the primary sources are honestly a really great place to start. I learned so much just from reading the Federalist Papers by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay and you can't go wrong with reading the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.\n\nNotes from Buck on Bitcoin:  For Bitcoin, the white paper includes a lot and isn't too technical either (https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/\u00a0- from the Nakamoto Institute which has a lot of great primary resources on the progenitors of Bitcoin as well as Austrian economics influences). Another one I mentioned was Hayek's Free Market Money:\u00a0https://fee.org/articles/hayeks-free-market-money/\n\nMotorcycling across China - 38,000 kilometers, every province\nRaising money for school lunches for village children in China\nResources for exploring the Great Ride:\nVideo of The Great Ride Across China:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0kuUkNRFQ8\u00a0\nWebsite:  http://thegreatrideofchina.com\nBook:  The Great Ride of China by Buck Perley\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Great-Ride-China-two-wheeled-adventure-ebook/dp/B072YSNJYZ\nAlso, photobook of the journey by Amy Perley\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Great-Ride-China-Exploring-Motorcycle/dp/0999074628\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OJSagODtV3o\n\nBooks mentioned during the conversation:\n\nA Walk Across America by Peter Jenkins:  https://www.amazon.com/Walk-Across-America-Peter-Jenkins/dp/160671323X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1N7464X9SQ19VC44JD7K\n\nTravels with Charley by John Steinbeck\nOn the Road by Mark Twain\n\nThe Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek\nFavorite podcast:  EconTalk\n\nSelected quotes from Buck\u2019s article on Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cIncredible research is taking place to explore more efficient rule enforcement mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake vs. Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work, but even these spend more time discussing how to more efficiently punish bad actors than the mechanisms that decide what constitutes a \u201cbad actor\u201d in the first place. This is like debating the most efficient way to put criminals in jail before discussing how to define what makes someone a criminal in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nature of humanity - put not your trust in Princes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that governance isn\u2019t necessary at all, or that even wanting governance represents a kind of power play, seems to me to naively misunderstand the nature of humanity. Even in a system governed by code, this viewpoint assumes there exist objective, final truths. The problem though is that we all live in our own subjective worlds with subjective values all of varying degrees of validity. Distribution of information isn\u2019t perfect, and distrust among groups is a natural byproduct. Further, to believe this is to ignore that, unlike gold which is physical and immutable, a cryptocurrency is comprised of code that can be improved and innovated on in an infinite number of ways, and from this underestimates the power and scope of that innovation while ignoring its capacity, in a subjective world, to create controversy.\nThis is something the U.S. founders were keenly aware of in the framing of a constitution- the capacity for humanity to evolve in unpredictable ways. So they created, however imperfectly practiced, a system based on universal and timeless values. In the words of Calvin Coolidge:\nAbout the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly restful\u2026 If all men are created equal, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people.\u201d", "duration": 3359, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "[Music]", "start": 0.0, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "haibach", "start": 2.21, "duration": 4.87}, {"text":
