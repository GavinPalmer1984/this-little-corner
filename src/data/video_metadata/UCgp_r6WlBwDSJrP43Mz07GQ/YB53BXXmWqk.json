 "description": "In today's discussion, Alex and I talked about the necessity of substantive prepared ecosystems prior to the introduction of life.  If you are mainly interested in the metaphysics, skip to minute 35 where we begin with data compression and symbolism. We also looked at the arrow of time and how that relates to entropy. From there, we moved into data compression and symbolism. That drew us towards a conversation about the Sam Harris/Jordan Peterson debate (At minute 48, we look at the difficulties in communicating and from there to Harris/Peterson and their challenges in seeing each other's world views) regarding the utopian future golden age/the necessity of transcendence in the construction of the past golden age, and we jumped from there to the Tower of Babel (Harris' argument mirrors a modern construct tin of the metaphorical tower), coercion in utopias, the necessity for sacrificing our victimhood and the inevitability of suffering exposing the need for deep meaning in our lives. We also examine the difference between empathy and compassion.\n\nMy apologies: In discussing the Eric Smith video, I inadvertently called him Eric McCloskey.  He was speaking at the McCloskey Speaker Series.\nNotes from the Dr. Eric Smith video:\nLife is powered by earth as a giant battery, iron at the surface drawn down to the iron at the core and recycled to the surface. \nThe Alvin Expedition forced us to reconsider what is living. Some of the rules of life are written into chemistry and planetary flows before there is ever material for evolution to act on.\nReconceptualizing life: ecosystems and universal metabolism.\nEcosystems are more fundamental than organisms. \nWhere does a particular life form get its energy? Reductionist (giving electrons, e.g. hydrogen) or Oxidative (taking electrons, e..g. oxygen).\nThe inevitability of life can be seen from the cycle of metabolism.\n\nLinks to the videos we discussed:\nDr. Eric Smith on New Theories on the Origin of Life\nhttps://youtu.be/0cwvj0XBKlE\nThe first of the four Sam Harris/Jordan Peterson debates:\nhttps://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\n\nInsight gained upon rewatching our discussion:\n\"The introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone.\" We discuss this quote in the video, but I didn't fully understand it until I went back to the video and watched it again. When we look back in time, randomness decreases (that is there is less entropy) and when we look forward in time, randomness increases (that is there is more entropy), and now I see that if we just look at this from a common sense level, of course that has to be true. The past is set in stone, so to speak. Lowest possible entropy. The future always includes the introduction of randomness because of the nature of the unknown, so of course, it must increase in entropy.",
