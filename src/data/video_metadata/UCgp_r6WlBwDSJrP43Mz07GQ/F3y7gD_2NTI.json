 "title": "Is a True Ecumenism Possible? Gavin Ashenden on the Catholic View of Developing a Christian Mind",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3y7gD_2NTI",
 "date": "2021-08-08",
 "description": "Gavin Ashenden, former Chaplain to the Queen of England, a university lecturer in psychology, had his own radio show on the BBC and now blogs at Ashenden.org. He converted from the Anglican Church to becoming a Catholic apologist for the faith. The story of his conversion: https://youtu.be/J-3CxAjbVBM\n\nWe started this conversation as a discussion on open and relational theology, process theology, etc., and Gavin quickly \"cut the Gordian knot\", cleared away what he called \"underbrush\" and wanted to talk about the necessity of developing the \"Christian mind\". \n\nHe sees Process theology as a form of existential narcissism. \"It allows me to be fascinated with myself.\"\n\nLife is this: the outer bit decays, the inner bit renews.\n\nWhitehead invites us to become egocentric narcissists - the idea that God risks part of Himself in my becoming. \n\nGavin points to Mother Julian who said that sin is \"behovely\". God takes sin and makes good out of it. \"All shall be well and all shall be well, and all manner of things will be well.\"\n\nHe says that \"Protestantism is founded on a category error.\" It starts history in 1520 and reads the Bible backwards in time. But the church grows due to the Holy Spirit leading us into all truth.\n\nProtestantism skipped all the councils that led to \"theotokos\", the understanding of who Mary is, and the detachment from possessions that led to orders like that of St. Benedict - communities of service.\n\nTeleology - heading for the kingdom of heaven.\nUtopian thinking skewed by impatience, pride and lust for power. I will MAKE it happen.",
