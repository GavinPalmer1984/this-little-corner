 "description": "Reggie Gibbs joins me to discuss his new novel, born out of his experience as a Marine in Iraq and his love for Russian history and philosophy.\nBeyond the Urals - https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Urals-Reggie-Gibbs/dp/1489732845/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=beyond+the+urals&qid=1612982189&sr=8-1\n\nBeyondtheUrals.com - Reggie's website for the book\n\nReggie lives and works in New York City and also volunteers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He attended the Citadel, graduating in 1998,\nand subsequently served in the infantry of the U S Marine Corps with 4 overseas deployments, two tours of Iraq, awarded the Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat V, denoting valor.\nHe traveled across Russia via the Trans-Siberian Railroad and received an MA from Georgetown University in Russian studies.\n\nHis parents instilled in him a belief that you never quit what you've started which came in handy making it through the Citadel and enduring the rigors of Marine life, long deployments and life on the battlefield.\n\nHis novel tells the story of a quest to find peace in the midst of turmoil and uncertainty and loss. Exploring ideas that arise in Russian literature and philosophy, he asks the question:  Is there something else out there? What is the nature of the Other? Do you believe man is inherently good, or fallen?\n\n\"In his epic novel \u201cBeyond the Urals,\u201d Reggie Gibbs takes us seamlessly into the vast, treacherous and foreboding landscape of Soviet Russia\u2019s World War II Siberia. The story that unfolds is a perfect blend of the two World War I masterpieces \u201cAll Quiet on The Western Front\u201d and \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d. Gibbs leaves nothing to our imagination in depicting the anguish of wartime separation as a young Russian soldier is injected into the grueling Soviet defense of Stalingrad, while the love of his life is sent off to Siberia with hundreds of thousands of others to transplanted military production factories. Using apparitional appearances of great Russian writers, thinkers and revolutionaries, along with drawing upon snapshots of Stalin\u2019s infamous show trials, famines that killed millions, and other historical events, Gibbs paints a stunning allegory of how the use of raw power can be utilized to change the DNA of a whole people. This novel is a triad of war, religion, and love amidst Stalin\u2019s terror-filled rule over Russia, played out in the daunting vastness of wartime Siberia.\"\n\n\u2014 David Cohen, Deputy Director for Operations, Central Intelligence Agency, 1995-97\n\nA quote from the book:  \"Russia\u2019s most noted philosophers, artists, novelists, and revolutionaries were all born and educated in the west, just like him. But their supreme contributions occurred after they experienced the east, as if their development, their mere existences, were not fully formed until they stepped into the Ural Mountains and beyond; as if their sleeping souls, crouching hidden beneath the formal rationalism and equations of their western educations, were suddenly awakened, infused with the obscure and cryptic passion that, as was once posited, enslaves reason.\"\n\nReggie Gibbs. Beyond the Urals (Kindle Locations 572-576).",
