The existence of a stable order of nature does not count as evidence against miracles, but rather such a stable order provides a backdrop against which miracles could be made visible. Mackey said that \"the laws of nature tell us how nature behaves when it is left to itself.\" By definition, a miracle would be how nature behaves when it is not left to itself.\n\nThe way to arrive at a reasonable belief is to examine the evidence in detail, and to ask yourself the question, \"How will I know if I am wrong?\" If I am trapped in confirmation bias and have locked myself into a particular world view, \"How will I find out if I am wrong?\"\n\n\"Our ignorance in the face of the hard problem (of consciousness) is not merely transitory, but is permanent, given our limited cognitive capacities (Colin McGinn 1989, 1991).  \nDr. McGrew 'strongmanned' the argument against miracles, then gave his position allowing the a possibility in the belief of miracles because of the importance of science, not in spite of it.\n\nIt was not the Copernican revolution that necessitated a meaning crisis. That did not occur until they pulled the plug on a God who cared for His creation. Many of the scientists post-enlightenment were very dedicated believers, seeking to answer the question, \"How does it (this question) reveal the mind of the Maker?\"\n\nHow to lessen confirmation bias? Read old books, for there, you will find writers who do not share your blind spots, just as you do not share theirs, but from whom you can learn amazing new ideas.
