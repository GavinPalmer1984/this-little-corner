 "description": "Glen and Karen discuss Truth and Reality. Do they inhabit the same space? Also Creativity, Trust networks and Constructor Theory.\nRe the JBP clip video on Truth, he says creativity requires you to be \"tied\" to the truth.\nGlen mentions Nima Arkani Hamed's view of truth, always beyond our reach, but the search for truth requires a searching moral inventory.\nTo do physics, you have to believe there is an objective reality.\nLifestyle disciplines are needed to approach the truth.\nCesar Hidalgo on Google Talks \"Why Information Grows\".\n\nOpportunity cost - limitations\nConsequences - constraints\nCollective unconsciousness OR distributed cognition?\nRobust trust networks tend to correlate to thriving economies.\nAre we partners in His creative effort?\nRules are there to help us be creative. 10 commandments\nDiscipline leads to peace.\n\"Thou shalt not bear witness against thy neighbor,\" not only means not to lie, but that if you bear false witness, you are putting mistrust out into the community and you can no longer trust the shared world.\nA trust network requires that truth is in the system.\n\nArguments from stability - you can't have a rational morality code.\nDawkins  - nature chooses stability over efficiency\nSociety is unstable in violence or threats of violence - even one person can cause this instability.\nChrist's death inoculated them from fear.\nIn the case of radon, small amounts of exposure actually inoculate people over time, but too much radon had negative consequences.\n\nConstructor Theory - an effort to put physics on an axiomatic basis, similar to what Godel was trying to do with Math.\nConstructor theory asks, What can be done in physics? What is possible/impossible.\nWhat is allowed but not derivable from first principles in an axiomatic/mathematics sense.\nComplicated things are just a bunch of simple things put together.\nInside is the complexity, Outside you are only dealing with a handful of details.\n\nEach layer hides the complexity from the next layer up.\n\nThe creative process is, \"I'm missing something, there's something I need to focus on, go back and look again.\"\nThe discipline that looks to see where the patterns are showing up.\nAbility to recognize patterns - overlaying patterns - condensed matter - quasi particles.\n\nMusic, math, art, truth - discovered or invented?\n\nAlso, Glen and I did a six part series on the beginning of life. Here's the playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoARw9zo4EUZhxqfaqYU5yjy0-Tr8RlB4",
