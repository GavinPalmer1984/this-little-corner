S. Lewis essay, The Weight of Glory.  Michael began thinking about the meaning of glory when reading John Chapter 17.\n\nThere is in the modern world a distillation of many things to get them down to a rubric that we can follow. But Love is hard to quantify. In the act of love, there is always this beyond. The process deepens and enriches us.\n\nThe transformational moments have long roots into the past.\n\nSehnsucht- the joy that is simultaneously longing and sadness.\n\nThe divide between contemplated (analytical thought( and enjoyed (sengsucht).\n\nPostmodernism maintains that all knowledge is social construction and that there is not objective truth, except, of course, postmodernism is objective truth.\n\nMeaning is all about the connection between the many and the One, with my story having a correspondence with the larger story.\nIt is the myth of the modern individual that we're disconnected from reality.\n\nPraise needs to be specific and authentic. Then it is transformational.\n\nOn the Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith: \"Man desires not only to be loved but to be lovely.\"\n\nHumility does away with the need for modesty. (C. S. Lewis)\n\nThe four P's of knowing (a gift from John Vervaeke) - nevertheless, we cannot experience one kind of knowing without ourselves intruding.", "duration": 4922, "transcript_parts": [{"text":
