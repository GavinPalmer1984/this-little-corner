 "description": "Scientism is just getting ever more precise accounts of the cave - the fleeting images of the world. \n\nStephen Wolfram's pathway is rising to something higher via mathematics and searching out metaphysical ideas for his theory of everything.\n\nMeanings of \"substance\"\n - Did he accomplish anything of substance?\n - He's a person of substance.\n - A plan without substance.\n - The substance of the report... \nIn philosophy, a thing considered as a continuing whole that survives the changeability of its properties.\n\nLack of meaning is a starvation of the human spirit.\nAlchemy, the dream that the substance could be found in the material world.\nIn the spiritual world, substance is hypostasis. Hypostasis is also a way to speak of the divine Trinity.\nHebrews 11:1:  Faith is the substance of things hoped for.\n\nJohn Vervaeke's comment that Reason was supplanted by Will.\nKaren posited that Reason maps to Gratitude and Humility while Will maps to Entitlement and Utopian Thinking.\n\nKaren and Mark discuss Authority and Obedience\n\nMark's 4 P's of knowing replaces the Perspectival with the Poetic and then uses Perspectival as the foundation or the way in to all of the 4 P's.\nKaren suggests adding a 5th P for the Passional, used in the sense of \"paschein\" or the permitting, suffering move of being transformed through the learning that comes of suffering.",
