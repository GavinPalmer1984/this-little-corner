They are prey animals and the fact that humans were able to build a relationship with them is amazing. Training used to be a left hemisphere oriented project - colonizing the horse, using force and fear, but about 100 years ago, they began studying how horses communicate with each other. \nTo engage properly with a horse, you have to set a parameter - put it in a round pen which becomes a virtual reality for the horse - chaos in its eyes. The boundary keeps it from running away.\n\nAs a trainer, you put pressure on, then release it, and that creates a dopamine hit when the horse does what you want it to do. Horse hierarchies (matriarchy) - the one at the top drives the other horses to the food and water, putting pressure on and then releasing it.\n\nHorses are flight or flight animals, but you want them to be in between, like a dance, a kind of balance. They feed off your energy, a communication of body language. We have to learn what they want to see from us in order to be able to be with us.\n\nBecause of this, Brad took a deep dive into psychology and science starting 9 years ago, and then when Jordan Peterson came on the scene, he could see  so many parallels with what he had learned. \n\nThe two hemispheres of the brain need to work together, the particular within context.\nNone of us can comprehend everything. We are tribal, need to rely on the group which needs to rely on each individual. We need the tribe but the tribe needs to look out for us, too.\n\nWe\u2019re not in the reality we were created for (can\u2019t get back to the garden).\nOur metaphors are still at base reality, so they are losing the embodiment of what the metaphors meant to begin with.\n\nAs technology has come, it has driven us to focus more on the left hemisphere, separating us from the roots of our psychology.\n\nEverything beyond the campfire is chaos - the unknown. When we re-institute a boundary, it can become a portal through which we can traverse the wave between chaos and order.\nOrder affirms that the metaphor is true because it works. Every metaphor has a boundary around it, but today, the boundaries are being torn down.\n\nBrad is a mechanical designer which is usually a Left hemisphere operation, mimicry, not much creativity, but once in awhile he is tasked with creating something entirely novel and must begin with nothing but a blank sheet of paper. In those times, with much reflection, ideas come from somewhere fully formed. How does that happen?\n\nMath is a beautiful language, but in our reality, it breaks down, because there is a tolerance around each number. If the tolerance is too tight, it excludes everything. We are stories. If the metaphors don\u2019t hold, the meaning is gone. There is a tolerance around the metaphor that must be recognized. If you break down that boundary, the meaning will be lost.\n\nAt the Tower of Babel, God changed their language,, not their speech. The language was the metaphors behind it. We are working with different metaphors, so true communication is extremely difficult.\n\nWe are privileging people who are more L hemisphere oriented. If people get a dopamine hit when they use the L hemisphere, they\u2019re gonna use the L hemisphere. Science is creating dopamine hits for the people inside it. Just before the Reformation was the advent of microscopes, telescopes, technical drawings, the printing press, a tendency to look inward at the particulars and miss the context.\n\nIn reality, some of the wisest people may have been illiterate.\n\nCulture is downstream from Technology. Politics is just a reaction to everything, always coming later.\n\nSilicon Valley is a small group of people, becoming a monolith of power, that have learned how to hijack our feedback loops by providing dopamine hits.\n\nWe need a kind of shortcut of \u201ctried and true\u201d as a way of applying a strategy to a situation, but also need to always be flexible to adjust for the context in a truthful and appropriate way.\n\nIn the old days, people needed to rely on one another. Called to love our neighbor, we need to focus more on spending time with our neighbors to rebuild that sense of community. How do we scale that up? In the past, it was the church. How can we do that now?\n\nHorse training videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtTz9GtAT4&t=2s&authuser=0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKK7AXLOUNo&t=127s&authuser=0\n\nwww.karenwongart.com\nwww.TheMeaningCode.com\n\nThe Meaning Code Youtube channel (lots more great content)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ?view_as=subscriber\n\nLoving to Know by N.
