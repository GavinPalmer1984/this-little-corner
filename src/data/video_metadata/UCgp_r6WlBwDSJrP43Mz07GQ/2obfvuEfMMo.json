Also, links to the Wolfram and Scharf videos and Nima Arkani Hamed's lecture on morality in physics.\n\nThread: I explain. As @jordanbpeterson says, we live in a nested world, all the way down, and may I add, all the way up. We benefit from computational reducibility. The brain has a \"model of the world\" and it has to \"choose which sensory input to sample\" in order to \"gather 1/ \nevidence for its own predictions,\" Karl Friston. This is computational reducibility at the simplest level. All life, and by analogy science, philosophy, domains of knowledge, seeks to move from A to B and encounters anomaly. That we can choose produces computational 2/8 \nirreducibility which is both the challenge and the glory of life. All choice is binary and must be made in the \"now\", good choices decreasing entropy, poor choices increasing it. Life injects unpredictability into the system. Computational reducibility is what 3/8 \nmakes science possible. It only works on that layer of the system that is predictable, quantifiable. Computational reducibility does not explain the whole, despite the claims of scientism, but it is a necessary component to improving life. It is a 4/8 \ngift that has resulted in scientific and technological advances beyond the wildest dreams of our forebears. It cannot, however, account for anomaly. Anomaly also is a gift that allows life to strive towards the goal of the upward call (strong emergence's topdown causality?) 5/8 \nEntropy gain establishes the arrow of time and that also is a gift, for without it, the tendency would be to roll back down to the starting conditions and try, try again, but entropy produces a forgetfulness, no longer enough information and too many states to put things 6/8 \nback to the way they were. Perhaps entropy is the price that must be paid for the gift of the layer of computational reducibility. In the words of @michael2l perhaps entropy is \"a layer of complexity that is introduced as a further space for a later resolution 7/8 \nof the temporal moral distortion that is brought about by our agency.\" In other words, we mess things up and a price must be paid. Much more to say. See Nima Arkani Hamed's lecture on the morality of fundamental physics and Stephen Wolfram's TOE. 8/8. \n\nCaleb Scharf and Brian Keating:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cizY1Eg4Cws&t=1963s\nStephen
