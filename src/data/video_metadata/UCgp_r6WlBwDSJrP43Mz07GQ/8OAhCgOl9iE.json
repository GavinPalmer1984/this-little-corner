Annette discusses the book in the last five minutes of the video.\n\nDirections Decca Aitkenhead could have taken in the Times article, but didn't:\n\nThe attributes of genius: open to experience, driven/idealistic, surprisingly humble, individualistic/rebellious/dislikes authority.\n\nThe contrast between Rachel (the outer, revealed world) v.\nLeah (the inner world of thought) - the archetype of the hated one.\n\nThe loss of balance in yin (cool, rest) and yang (heat, restless).\n\nBy not focusing on the work Jordan Peterson has done to help people, Aitkenhead lost the opportunity to bring light into the world by making sense of Jordan's story.\n\nThe book is available for free download from 2/9 through 2/11/21, and as the book is updated, your version will be updated as well.
