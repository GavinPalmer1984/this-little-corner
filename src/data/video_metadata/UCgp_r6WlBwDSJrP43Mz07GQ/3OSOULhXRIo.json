 "description": "The Deep Magic Reveals Reality, The Incarnation of the Word, Finding Christ in the Pages of Harry Potter\n\n0:00 - 22:30 \nJon\u2019s life story\n22:30 \nQuote from On the Incarnation by Athanasius \nMagic Reveals Reality\n28:45 \nAslan and the Deep Magic\nThe incarnation unlocks reality to the world, a true incantation spoken into reality.\u2019\n \nThe hinge on the door that was shut against humanity\n\n32:00 \nVervaeke\u2019s 4 P\u2019s, The Word, Love as initiation and response, The Way, The Truth and The Life, Goodness, Truth and Beauty - a paradigm\nWorship is our telos. The wine and the bread is our participation in the body of Christ.\n\nChrist gave us Himself to restore that which is permanent and fixed.\nBeauty yields the fruit of goodness and that reveals the truth.\nWe begin in the shire and end in the shire.\n\n44:00 \nThe New Testament interprets the Old Testament\n\n52:00 \nMichael Levin and cancer as a loss of community\n\n1:00:30 \nCan you lose your salvation is the wrong question\n Why do people walk away? Personalism doesn\u2019t work\n\n1:18:10 \n\u201cI\u2019m not an apologist for Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nThe Exodus story is not just my story\n\nThe story of Harry Potter is one in which the victim becomes the heroic force for good.\nEvil inspires fear which leads to either silence or propaganda (explanatory tyrannical structure)\nGoodness finds its expression in family, friendship and community.\n\nVoldemoort doesn\u2019t experience community.\nMiddle Earth has a softer magic.\nEvil is the using of magic to corrupt nature, to deny reality, to use it as a tool for one\u2019s own purposes.\nThe Elves in Tolkien create beauty and reveal reality.\n\u201cThis house believes\u2026\u201d is the narrowing of our language into propositions.\nThe deconstructed develop their own communities in which they can all share the same story, the same language, the same propositions. Innovation, creativity, diversity, the beauty of individuality are all extinguished when we fall into the trap of an ideology which is an incomplete version of truth.\n\nBook recommendations:\nWhat the Bible is All About by Henrietta Mears\nReading Backwards by Richard Hayes\nJonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke\nPiranesi by Susanna Clarke\nThe Lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien\nThat Hideous Strength by C S Lewis\nThe Great Divorce by C S Lewis\nOn the Incarnation by Athanasius w/ foreword by C S Lewis\n\nVideo Clip from Curt Jaimungal's interview with Michael Levin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TNfysTazc&t=1807s",
