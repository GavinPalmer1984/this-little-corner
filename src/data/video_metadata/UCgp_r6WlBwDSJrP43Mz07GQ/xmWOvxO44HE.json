In 2001, he went from being a militant atheist to a believer in Jesus Christ.\n\nAlong the way, he fell in love with the work of Sylvia Plath, Curt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamps, Matta and John Keats.\nWe talk about how easy it is to make an idol of intellect, genius, art and driven goals.  Memorable quotes:\n\"The utility of the bowl is in the empty space.\" Lao Tsu\nWhat's not said gives the viewer the opportunity to enter in.\n\"Negative capability\" - John Keats\nChaos is where the unexpected connections happen, things you\ncouldn't plan out.\nAt the foot of the cross, we learn the fear of the Lord and the devastating consequences of our sin, all of which He took upon Himself. From the resurrection and the empty tomb, we learn the love of the Lord.\nThe life of Job prepares us for times of persecution, for we see that suffering is bearable because Christ is our life, He has already given us everything we need.\n\nKaren's conversations with Paul VanderKlay:\nFirst: (this is the conversation in which I lay out my vision of the how the world works)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlMgGkwWUNY\nSecond: (This is where I tell the story of my life)\nhttps://youtu.be/ZC03aNsPHOQ\nKaren's interview with Mary Kochan on the Elements and Principles mentioned in the first video with Paul.\nhttps://youtu.be/rdjfxPnHqZs\n\nArt and Fear by Orland and Bayles - highly recommend this book!", "duration": 6267, "transcript_parts": [{"text":
