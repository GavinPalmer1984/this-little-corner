Language as one of the most fundamental things.\nContraction and Expansion - the process of the evolution of language\n(its relationship to art and science)\nMaterial and Immaterial\nDogma - the protective resiliency to change so that it can survive long enough, stay continuous through time (built in redundancy)\nFigurative language\nMetaphor\nfinesse v geometry\nWhen you personify something, you see more of what's going on.\n(What does it want? What is It going to do?\"\nPatterns, symmetry, proportion, imperfections\nIrreducible complexity when people are telling their own story, the marker of truth.\nSnowflakes and Fairy Tales\n\nBeyond
