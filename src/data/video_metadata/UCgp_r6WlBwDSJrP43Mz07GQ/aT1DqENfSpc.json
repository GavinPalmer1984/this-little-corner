Participatory into Perspectival into Procedural into Propositional. John says the new atheists have cut off the propositional from all other types of knowing. \n\nSituational Awareness bridges the value gap.\n\nPerspectival is deeper than a level of knowing.\n\nPropositions are navigated by the procedures.\n\nAccepting or rejecting the icon because of what's behind it. (Perhaps because it's too scary or too dangerous).\n\nIf there's no observer, there's no object. The subject is subject to the object.The object is subject to the observer.\n\nThe ineffable, the Transcendent.\nSo, God is (says Jordan), by definition, what escapes our categorizing.\n\nNegative theology, apophatic theology vs. God of the gaps. \n\nJBP and JV discuss icons and idols. JBP makes the leap that art is the icon and propaganda is the idol. Discussion follows on the various aspects of each, the differences, the potential for confusion.\n\nIsaiah 44, Habakkuk 2, Psalm 115 (if you put your trust in it, it's an idol. \"This will make me happy.\" \"This will fix my problems.\")\nBiblical references to idols and what differentiates them.", "duration": 6646, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "mark and i are back at it again today", "start":
