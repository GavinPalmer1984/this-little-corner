Lewis, Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning, and Owen Barfield. \nPropaganda  1) as a false dichotomy 2) as a Zip Bomb or a destroyer of worlds\nThe Mandelbrot Set as a picture of the limits of stability, the border between order and chaos in its infinite complexity\nWords as containers for meaning\nOwen Barfield's The History of Words (words have souls)\n\nMichael's recent chat with Paul VanderKlay:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9C4VR9CyjM&t=389s\n\nKaren's website:  https://karenwongart.com\nKaren's chats with Paul VanderKlay:\nhttps://youtu.be/HlMgGkwWUNY\nhttps://youtu.be/ZC03aNsPHOQ\n\nOur next convo will discuss how we can know Truth. How do we recognize falsehood? Rationalism v. Joy. The difference between the Why and the How.  How far does Apologetics take us?
