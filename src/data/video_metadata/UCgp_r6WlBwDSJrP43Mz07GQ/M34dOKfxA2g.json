 "description": "Mary and I discuss the conversation John Vervaeke and Paul Vanderklay had around Paul's argument from personhood for the existence of God. In the process, we covered some aspects of quantum mechanics, philosophy, theology and the nature of reality.  Regarding God's completeness and the essence of potential and actuality, we also looked at Jordan Peterson's theories about order and chaos, value and the interest that is our future drawing us forward. We finish up rejoicing over God's generosity in making us to share in His love and to have fellowship with one another in this cross-shaped universe.\n\nPaul and John's conversation:  https://youtu.be/65CcfvXXHug\n\nPaul's video about Sevilla and Jonathan discussing the metaphysics of quality:  https://youtu.be/Z0Y3XYVA7dg",
