not be a distinction", "start": 325.919, "duration": 2.401}, {"text": "between the two", "start": 327.44, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "and so you approach the question of is", "start": 328.32, "duration": 3.599}, {"text": "this a", "start": 331.36, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "cell anymore so is the fact that this", "start": 331.919, "duration": 6.401}, {"text": "lost its boundary is it

3.76}, {"text": "whatever the cell was surrounded by it", "start": 349.28, "duration": 3.359}, {"text": "so we've changed the", "start": 351.28, "duration": 5.12}, {"text": "object entirely as soon as its boundary", "start": 352.639, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "was changed or or was removed um", "start": 356.4, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "so i you i like that idea too is that", "start": 359.759,

if you look at", "start": 3615.2, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "what is it um oh that's right yeah", "start": 3619.2, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "yeah so yeah the energy of a photon is", "start":
