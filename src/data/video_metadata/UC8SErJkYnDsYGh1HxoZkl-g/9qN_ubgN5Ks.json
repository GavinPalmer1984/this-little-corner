But what does that mean? Is it appropriate to teach children everything in the Bible?\n\nAre there clues written into the Bible that help us understand how it should be taught to children? Conversely, if the Bible is written in such a way that it can be read to a mixed age audience, could there be info that goes over the heads of children, but makes sense to adults?\n\nI explore these questions while comparing the narratives in the Bible to other children\u2019s stories such as Disney\u2019s Pinocchio, the Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, and Aladdin, as explained by Jordan B. Peterson. \n\nI examine the use of euphemism, parallel story structure, and cultural references, and I believe that this is a useful hermeneutical tool to help us understand the scripture more deeply.", "duration": 2489, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "so today i want to talk about", "start": 0.399, "duration": 4.561}, {"text": "reading the bible for children", "start": 2.48, "duration":
