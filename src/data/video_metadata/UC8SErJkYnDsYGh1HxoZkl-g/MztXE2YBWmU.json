 "title": "The Most Coherent Interpretation of Genesis 1-11 You've Ever Heard.",

 "description": "This video summarizes the conclusions of a line of research that brings a unifying and coherent theme to the antediluvian history recorded in Genesis. This comprehensive view does not treat the accounts of these chapters as distinct events, but explains them in one continuous narrative \n\nSpecifically this video deals with the personal narrative accounts of the people after Creation and the Fall and expulsion from the Garden of Eden, the stories of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4), the genealogies  of Cain and Seth, (Genesis 5), The Watchers and the Nephilim Giants (Genesis 6) the flood (Genesis 7-8) and the account of Noah's drunkenness (Genesis 9)\n\nThe full paper explaining this video is available here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRz_vVkyNS6VsJwhO-p3Np70XsdNtZQ-2N3qQe9cuGqHrE9bdbF6QT169qjiPujBvr1tdro0IaHsDrc/pub\n\nI also made a commentary/explanation video giving more of the details. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Q-q7WDxci9c\n\nThis paper also reconciles the similarities and differences between the Genesis account and the account in the Book of 1 Enoch.\n\nHopefully this video will make its way to Jonathan Pageau, so he can add his symbolic interpretation of Genesis in light of how I put forth the events in this video. This would also likely enhance his effort to understand universal history. For my research, I relied mostly on the text of the bible, in preference to traditions, together with reason and logic. I also made this work in light of the monumental advancements in theology and biblical understanding made since the protestant reformation, which have brought freedom and joy to millions of Christians all over the world.  \n\nAlso credit goes to Michael Heiser, although I challenge one of his interpretations, I uphold his supernatural view of the events in Genesis 6, and in the light of the other events, the other views become indefensible.",
