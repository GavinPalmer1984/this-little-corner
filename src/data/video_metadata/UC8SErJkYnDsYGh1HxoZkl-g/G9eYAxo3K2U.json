 "description": "This video is examining not only the song, but the phenomenon of reactions, covers and analysis created in response to Jacob Collier\u2019s version of Moon River. \n\nI also examine how this phenomenon illuminates the creative process, the way people interpret and react to seemingly simple things, and how this relates to the way that people react with more complex works like the Bible, and critique the limits of the post-modernist worldview and the necessity of upholding the idea of antithesis (the Francis and Frankie Schaeffer conundrum.) \n\nAll the content is used within the limits of fair use license. \n\nA playlist with all the features videos is provided here: Accompaniment for the video \u201cDistributed Digital Time-Travel - Metaphorical and Spiritual analysis of Moon River by Jacob Collier\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfgmmACBvpSgvOKKlQQMjJqV13IFTLYlb",
