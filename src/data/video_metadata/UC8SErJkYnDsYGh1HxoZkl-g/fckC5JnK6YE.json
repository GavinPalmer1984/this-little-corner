While this is a valid and important question to ask of the bible, it should be set aside for the time being. \n\nWhat type of \u201cfiction\u201d is the bible?\n\nIn modern terms - the ancient and internal heart of a hard-magic modern epic fantasy.\n\nWhat do I mean by this?\n\nWithin many fantasy series, there are internal books or documents. Sometimes these are only images from which the author can draw small snippets, such as the internal book \u201cThe way of Kings\u201d in Brandon Sanderson\u2019s book, \u201cthe way of kings\u201d\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien has several allusions to this sort of internal writing; the Silmarillion is the \u201cbible\u201d of the Lord of the Rings, and \u201cthere and back again\u201d is Bilbo\u2019s telling of the Hobbit, within the world of middle earth. \n\nThe Bible is an internal story to our reality - but it does not encompass our reality, it is contained within it. \n\nIt is also ancient - and for this reason it requires a certain level of respect towards its ambiguity - we have to be somewhat satisfied realizing that we cannot talk to the human recorders or first readers, but we can study and speculate as to the similarities and differences of culture, and languages that it was written in. \n\nHard-magic: What does this mean? There are two aspects that differentiate between fantasy books that have hard and soft magic systems. Hard magic is a system of magic that has natural laws and principles that cannot be broken. Soft magic is more ambiguous and can describe books where the power of \u201cmagic\u201d can be used to do almost anything, and the rules are not defined. \n\nHowever, while many books can be described as soft-magic, because the writer does not necessarily explain or define the rules of the magic, the magic itself may be a hard-magic system because certain things are possible and others are not, there are rules and limitations, they are simply not expressed within the text itself. \n\nThe development of hard magic is (i believe) an answer to the problem of materialism in the world - \u201cbecause it\u2019s magic\u201d is not a satisfying answer for the modern reader, so magic becomes a type of science, in a supernatural setting \n\nThis is also why only the most forward thinking science fiction books can remain relevant - as real science outstrips the technology of older sci-fi, it has not been able to deliver the future that was once hoped for.\n\nDune will remain the king of sci-fi because it is essentially post-sci-fi fantasy - \n\nThe bible reads like soft magic, but it exists in a world of hard magic. Many of the miracles described in the bible could be replicated today, because we understand science and the laws of nature, and we have harnessed technology that makes great feats possible. But the underlying truth behind technology is that the world has natural laws put in place by God, and this is why experimentation can lead to progress. \n\nWhile materialists of the 19th and 20th centuries wanted to believe that everything was explainable by understanding the material world, we have come to the limits of what matter alone can explain. Underneath the physical rules we can observe and understand, there are deeper rules we do not understand. We thought for a brief moment that there was no magic, but as it turns out, everything is magic. \n\nThere are also \u201cmagical\u201d elements in the bible that cannot be explained or reproduced technologically, and so there are other forms of magic besides the intentional manipulation of nature. The Bible is internally consistent in explaining that there are certain unique attributes of God, and of other spiritual beings. We cannot explain or understand these elements, but it would be logical to assume that there are some rules that must be followed by spiritual forces, even if they can subvert the rules of the material world as we understand them.\n\nGod Himself has no limitations, but He does not seem to practice the absurd, at least on a large scale, so He has tendencies that we can observe, but we cannot define any limits to His power. \n\n\nThe Bible is a modern fantasy because it takes us up to the current age. We have a spoiler for the ending, but we know that the story itself is not complete. \nIt is epic because it encompasses everything. Once we understand the story of the bible in the way that I am proposing, it becomes something more than just a book. It\u2019s an internal story (the most integral one) of a bigger story. \n\nThere are also different \u201csystems\u201d of magic within the bible, and the biblical worldview \n\nScience is one\nMiracles is another\nPrayer is another - \nOmniscience is highly underrated - the ability to hear from God is the ability to tap into or benefit from His omniscience -", "duration": 2853,
