Just an explanation of why I decided to start a channel. \n\nJordan B. Peterson has explained many places that a platform like YouTube is a powerful new technology, which makes complex information far easier to digest. For this reason, I am attempting to adapt my ideas from written form to video. \n\nI speak briefly about my interests, which include Christianity and the Bible, science, history, and especially how these ideas converge. \n\nI give a bit of my background, and explain my desire to initiate better conversation between tribal groups in regards to how different ideas connect. \n\nIn future videos I plan to explain in more detail how my understanding of a biblical worldview has encouraged me to seek out diverse authors and content creators to form a unified understanding of how the world works. I plan to discuss Christian authors such as C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, and Michael S. Heiser, as well as scientific authors such as Steven Pinker and Bret Weinstein. \n\nI am encouraged by channels such as Jonathan Pageau, Paul VanderKley, and Byrne Powers, A.K.A the Anadromist. The discussion and ideas they all present is refreshing and honest, without being propagandistic. \n\nIf this interests you and you like some of my ideas, I hope you will consider following my channel as I add new material.", "duration": 1093, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "i wanted to explain why i decided to", "start": 4.0, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "start a video channel", "start": 6.799,
