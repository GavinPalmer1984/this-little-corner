 "description": "This is an essay I wrote in October of 2020. \n\nThe original can be found at ezekiel337.com\n\nHere is the new preface I added:\n\nThis article in many ways represents     the core foundation for why I wanted to start a video channel. I have a high level of openness to new ideas. But my openness is tethered to the bedrock of my faith; the belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. Holding onto that one truth, I have challenged many of my presuppositions about the Bible, and the world we live in. The realization that I have come to is this. There are many possible ways that some things in the Bible can be interpreted; but I do not think there is any other guidebook or worldview that comes close to explaining or making sense of our lived reality. I have changed many of my opinions about doctrines, most of them have gone from me being sure about one view, to leaning toward particular truths, but holding the possibility that I could be wrong in many places. That means I can hope for what I think would be the best truth, but I must try to live as if the hardest or scariest possible explanation may be true. Ultimately, I believe that living in that tension is the most biblical way to live. We trust an all powerful, all knowing, and eternal God, who is good and loving. But our understanding of all those concepts, including goodness and love, are woefully limited. This is where faith comes in. But it is not blind faith that leaps across a dark abyss, it\u2019s the final step of faith that the ground I see before me will be solid enough, because the many steps before have brought me this far safely. Jesus said that the way is narrow, and sometimes it might require us to put one foot right in front of the other. But in that spot where our foot is meant to fall, there is no more solid ground in the universe, and He is not afraid of us poking and prodding with whatever tools we have at hand - that is wisdom. Over time, our doubt should shift away from questioning His word, and His path, and instead look to the ground around us. Not because we should desire to stray from his path, but because we need to find suitable on-ramps for those around us. We need to be able to look at the world around us and say to those near us, \u201cthose questions will lead you here, to the truth.\u201d We must also be able to say, \u201cdon\u2019t go that way, it will lead you farther away from the path.\u201d But to do this effectively, we must be able to speak as those who know. Not with arrogance, or dismissiveness - those things can motivate people, but it won\u2019t give them confidence in the truth. We need to show them that we have probed the ground, that we have already walked on that path, and we know which way to go. If we can show others that we stand on solid ground, we can extend our hands toward them without fear of falling. \n\nThe voice of criticism so often comes from the detractors, but if we as believers engage in a little bit of skepticism, the best parts of our faith will grow far stronger roots, and if we can endure a little pain and embarrassment, there is a whole world of wonder on the other side.",
