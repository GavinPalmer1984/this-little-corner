 "description": "This is a brief chat with Dr. Vaughn Mancha. He is a medical doctor and expert in the field of epigenetics, which he has been studying for decades and has read thousands of journal articles and papers on the subject. \n\nHe has a Facebook group where he regularly posts information and can be found here \n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/groups/2805417109680219/?ref=group_browse\n\nHe also has a YouTube channel with some videos and playlists, and he has been featured giving presentations on other channels as well. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/IvKvD2U5A20\n\nhttps://youtu.be/59GxS4tF8Sk\n\nDr. Mancha reached out to me after I shared a video about the spiritual implications of epigenetics. You can see that video here. \n\nTotal depravity: epigenetic consequences of the fall\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Aw2DfahtXkQ\n\nEpigenetic Easter eggs, locusts and the Bene Gesserit breeding program\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LP7YPBZcAGY",
