 "description": "This short video is pointing to longer article I wrote on this subject on substack, because some times I like writing more than talking. \n\nhttps://mikesartori.substack.com/p/the-root-of-joy-is-discovered-in?r=10qdli&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=direct\n\nYou can subscribe and leave comments on the article itself if you choose to read it.\n\nThe article was inspired by the events regarding Jordan B. Peterson criticizing the selection of Yumi Nu for the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition on Twitter, but mainly focuses on the terrible response of large amounts of conservatives who were hyper critical of Ms. Nu\u2019s body and appearance. A free market approach to defining beauty as women who are the most sexually attractive to men is not going to help combat the ideological takeover of LGBTQ Etc, community. Christians can promote a message that truly does find beauty in every person, but we must take it back and correct it to align with God\u2019s word.",
