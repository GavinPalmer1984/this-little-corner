 "description": "#marriageequality #purityculture #christianity #pornaddiction \n\nHere is a video that is mostly personal testimony, with some opinions based on what I\u2019ve learned in these areas. \n\nThese are things I would have liked to have been able to discuss with Paul VanderKlay during our rando conversation, but time didn\u2019t allow. \n\nThis is in response to many of his videos on the crisis of men and women, \u201cmarriage equality\u201d, and how the church deals with sex in general. Below are my notes for this video. \n\nMy story - \n\nParallel story lines - exposure to pornography, raised in a homeschool, purity culture\n\nTeen years were an intensification of both things - \nGave my speech, \u201cdating with integrity\u201d \n\nPursued ministry, when I felt It was the right time pursued marriage \n\nI had made an idol out of doing things right, and felt that God was punishing me for using pornography -\n\nI didn\u2019t handle rejection well, and I didn\u2019t do much to improve myself in the traditional sense because I thought God would honor me for my religiosity -\n\nTim Keller\u2019s book counterfeit gods shattered my illusions - \n\nI realized that I needed to see God\u2019s will, even if it was that I would be single, and if that was God\u2019s desire for my life, I would be happier single than I would be committed. \n\nGod released me from that, and led me to my wife, who I had been friends with for a long time. \nIt was scary.\nI have zero doubts that this is the woman that God intended me to be with - \nWhile on paper we fit the criteria of the purity culture, we still have hang ups.\nIt\u2019s still really hard. \nMarriage is to make us holy, not happy\n\nShe pushed me to become more complementarian; it\u2019s better - egalitarian marriage is based on equity, not equality, it sinks to the level of the lowest common denominator.\n\nThe true christian sexual ethic is an almost impossible ideal; everyone falls short \nThe purity movement was not perfect, and it was too rigid, and some people were hurt by it, but the wholesale abandonment of it is not good \nNo system is perfect; but there are less divorces from many of my classmates\n\nEach person has 3 options - live alone, live with the opposite sex, live with the same sex.\n\nFor each person, you could rank the difficulty #1,2 & 3. \nFor each scenario, some aspects will be difficult and others easy\n\nWhy has the church abandoned purity? Joshua harris version was not perfect, but it should have been improved, not thrown away\nWhy has the church been so weak on pornography? Our failure here is what makes our protests of marriage equality sound so judgemental. We have a log in our own eye.\n\nThis is participation in evil - it's a whole thing - all the way down to human trafficking and abortion. \n\nThe true christian sexual ethic \nAbstinence until marriage, no touching the swimsuit areas \nFaithfulness to death, even in light of transgressions by their partner - Hosea\nThe spouse is to be the lone object of sexual desire and should not be compared to others \nSpouses should serve one another sacrificially, and expect nothing in return. - both partners should consider themselves the lesser\nForgiving all sins\nNot sinning against your spouse \n\nIf someone could follow all of this perfectly, but be doing it with someone who is of the same gender, then they would probably be more holy than most people in most heterosexual marriages. \n\nThe true christian sexual ethic is extremely hard - but it creates a safe place where people can be truly happy. If the church had a legitimate argument in the public that we have the true key to sexual fulfilment, it would be spiritual dynamite. It would be devastating to the culture. \n\nWe have civil marriages - churches should be loving and accepting of those who want to attend \n\nFor the church to perform the ceremony is to put a blessing on something that God has not blessed - \n\nPerhaps we could do away with institutional christian marriages - if we believe in the priesthood of all believers, written about in 1 Peter,  two people could simply choose to be married - but they would be responsible before God to uphold the sexual ethics of the Bible.",
