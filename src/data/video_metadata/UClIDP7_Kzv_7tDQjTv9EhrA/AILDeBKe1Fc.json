 "description": "things that are objectively evil \n\nchild molestation\nrape\nmurdering someone in cold blood\ngiving children gender reassignment\n3rd trimester abortion\ntreating people differently and antagonizing people based off of race or sexuality\nleaving Americans behind in Afghanistan and not taking responsibility for it\nmanipulating housing and stock markets and then bailing out the people who do it after there greed causes economic collapse\nendless money printing\nendless wars in the middle east\nusing the media to terrorize its own citizens using fear tactics\nforcing people to receive experimental medicine by taking away their ability to work and travel \n\nbeing a coward and not speaking out against these things for the last 30 years I've been alive \n\nthese things are evil\nthe people who are doing these evil things must be stopped\nnot through revolution or by obtaining power\nbut by speaking out against these things and saying that it is wrong\nthis is not my opinion or perspective\nyou do not have to be a pastor or even a Christian to agree with this. It doesn't matter if you believe in Buddha, Allah, or your a scientologist. It doesn't matter if you've never been involved with any of this or you yourself have committed one of these acts. Evil is evil. We know what it is. It can be defined.\n\n\nRomans 12:21\nBe not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. \n\nProverbs 28:1 \nThe wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion. \n\n2 Timothy 1:7\nFor God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\nTake no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them",
