wax\nstretched out hand as far as I can\nI'm met half way with an infinite grasp\neternity suspended in limited man\nthat's some trippy shit when think like that\neat the scroll and lose control\nthe ancients foretold this long ago\nso before i sit down to eat my eggs and toast\nmake the most of the day i thank the holy ghost\nim embodied\ntall poppy\ncant stop me\nyall all talking\ncarbon copies\nsorry richard dawkins\nimma hafta pass\nnone of this world was meant to last\n\n\nI am on a vibe that's taking me high\nangels draw near when you take this flight\nnot afraid of death or losing my mind\nI'm just  tumbling exisiting through time\nin over my head that means baptized\nfalling through space and swimming in light\nooh swimming in light\nGod is in a trip and im in it for the ride\nGod is in a trip and im in it for the ride\n\n\n\nthe waters rising waters rising\nin the dark the father finds me\nthey all doubted said the time would never come\n but loook how now at the stars they are aligning\nkeep my head on straight in the midst of catastrophe\ncareful what your asking me\nif your scared ofblasphemy\nif you looking for cookie cutter\nu might wanna click something other\nits sink or swim cuz\nwaters getting hotter\nadapt or die \nhave to try\ncatholism in cataclysmic times\nthank you baby jesus for the gift of ryhmes\n and this dont give a fuck attitude of mine\nI'm just chilling feeling\nlike if there is a ceiling\nthen baby i aint seeing it\nive been invaded by a supreme diety\naint no secret just  change of frequency\n\n\nI am on a vibe that's taking me high\nangels draw near when you take this flight\nnot afraid of death or losing my mind\nI'm just  tumbling exisiting through time\nin over my head that means baptized\nfalling through space and
