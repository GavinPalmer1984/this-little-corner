Then come, follow me.\u201d\n\n22 At this the man\u2019s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.\n\n23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d\n\n24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \u201cChildren, how hard it is[e] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\n26 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMalice interviews Yeonmi
