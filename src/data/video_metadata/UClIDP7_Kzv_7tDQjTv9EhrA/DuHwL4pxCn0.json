signs\r\nAnd encourage new searches for purpose in this burdened life\r\nFor these anointed vessels\r\nThe playing fields has been leveled\r\nNeither angels or devils\r\nCan slow it down or help it\r\nI sense a change of temperature\r\nI didn\u2019t learn in seminar\r\nSpirit will go secular\r\nHidden in a metaphor\r\nI'm inspired, to retire and be quiet and wait\r\nto rewire, an empire an entire mind state\r\nThis fire thats acquired inspired by faith\r\na desire that\u2019s supplying higher ways\r\nIts exquisitely intricate\r\nisn't it?\r\ncontradicting history\r\nan innocent blunt instrument \r\nintimate and spirit lead\r\nhere is the difference if it isn't yet obvious\r\nwe're defying common sense with divine confidence\r\n7 billion children\r\nEach one of them are different\r\nthat\u2019s 7 billion religions\r\nOn the planet we live in\r\nSome believe in heaven\r\nsome believe in hell\r\nsome don\u2019t believe in God \r\nor even in themselves\r\nBut they all believe in music\r\nthey all believe in love\r\nEveryone believes in something whether inside or above\r\nI believe I've yet to see the person I'll become\r\nBut its somebody I couldn't have ever even dreamed of\r\nThis randomness isn't by accident\r\nI've got a scandalous habit of\r\ncatching the miraculous\r\nin moments of tragedy\r\nfeeling gravity no longer matters\r\nAs the limits I once had now have been shattered\r\nWhy did I once fear what comes after\r\nWhen all death will be is a greener pasture\r\nWhat started as a small seed, \r\nis now much more indeed\r\nThis idea increases,
