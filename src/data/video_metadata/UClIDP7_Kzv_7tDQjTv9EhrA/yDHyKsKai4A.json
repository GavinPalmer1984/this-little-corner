And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. 2 The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. 3 One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 4 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, \u201cWho is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?\u201d\n\nTheres some people in these end days wanna play pretend games\nthe rest of us see through this shit like a fuckin x ray\nif you are offended then pastor you are too late\ndont nobody is listening to anything that you say\nwhen they closed the churches down we should have know what this was\nsaying we cant be with family for christmas\nthey slap you on the cheek then ask you for forgiveness\nyall do what you wanna do thats none of my business Father \n\nhope you hear me\nas this world this ending\nI'm trying to have faith cuz\nI'm not im good at pretending\nIf they wanna call me crazy\nits fine baby \njust let em\nI'll keep having faith cuz\nI'm not im good at pretending\n\nits a cooky combination \nof this mass formation\nmisinformation\nyou cant see the slave ship\nwords are precious these days aint no time to waste them\npeople dont listen, not my job to save them\neveryone whose gonna know\nalready knows\ntheres some tough times ahead of us ill tell you that fo sho\nif i was preaching at you that would mean that i have hope\nif i was preaching at you that would mean that i have hope",
