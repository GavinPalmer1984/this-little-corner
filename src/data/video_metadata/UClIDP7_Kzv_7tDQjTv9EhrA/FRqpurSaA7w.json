circumstance\nSynchronicity waters the seed and now you have a plant \nAnd if God wanted all the unknown to be clear\nHe'd wave a magic wand so that you could see it clear\nBut that would too easy man you dont understand\nThis story's got some twists and turns he likes it like that\nThey say your pain can be reduced to biochemistry \nTheir theory of everything \nForgot to factor destiny\nFrom the darkness and the unknown\nGod spoke behold\nHere you are baby boy and look how you have grown\nThings change\nEach day\nAnd Don't stay the same\nEmbrace the pain\nMake way for God's grace\nIt's okay you don't gotta have this figured out boy\nAll you gotta do is learn how to enjoy the ride\n\n\nCuz If it's all just random\nAnd there's no such thing as magic\nAnd there is no soul or spirit just molecules and atoms\nHow are you so beautiful\nHow are you so beautiful\nIf there's a simple explanation\nAnd there is no great creator\nAnd all we do can be reduced to animal behavior\nHow are you so beautiful\nHow are you so beautiful\n\nWhat I'm looking for I don't think imma find In a book\nGod is all around us dude but we forget to look\nAll I need is good soil and sunshine\nSome water and The right vibe\nLet my leaves reach to the sky\nthe rest just takes time\nThis little light of mine I just gotta let it shine\nKeep trying to remind em that God resides inside\nAnd give grace, And be kind\nDon't fly off the handle all the time\nCuz you don't know what's going on in someone elses life\nAnd you are not a kog in a machine\nYou are something God has dreamed\nLook not to what is seen\nTrust the light your following\nAnd trust the process\nCuz in this world of objects\nIt's all an illusion leading you to something constant\nAnd people like to say the world is only the material\nOh yee of little faith \nwhy you overthinking it\nYou are just actor in the story God is writing\nYou don't get to choose what happens that's what makes this thing exciting\n\nCuz If it's all just random\nAnd there's no such thing as magic\nAnd there is no soul or spirit just molecules and atoms\nHow are you so beautiful\nHow are you so beautiful\nIf there's a simple explanation\nAnd there is no great creator\nAnd all we do can be reduced to animal behavior\nHow are you so beautiful\nHow are you so beautiful", "duration": 249, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "first the seat goes
