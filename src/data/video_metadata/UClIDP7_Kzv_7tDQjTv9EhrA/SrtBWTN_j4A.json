Thank you for all the support! Please like and subscribe and support the message and the dream!\n\nThe grieving process is different for everybody. When my dad passed away last year it didn't affected me in a way I expected. This was my first experience with death and fortunately/unfortunately I was able to be there for the short period between his diagnosis (Sept 2014) to his passing (Nov 2014). TWO MONTHS! TWO FREAKING MONTHS!! He was perfectly fine, there was nothing on our radar to make us think he would all of a sudden get an extremely aggressive version of colon cancer. This rattled my being and everything that I thought I once believed. \n\nThe truth is, if we're honest, we kind of live in a denial of death. We create 5 year plans, 10 year car payments, and 30 year mortgages. But what if your gone tomorrow? What's the point of any of that. What if I die tomorrow? What if my wife dies tomorrow? For me personally the idea that I could just get hit by a bus tomorrow and this whole thing is just over, to me, is more than trippy, its terrifying. \n\nPeople say live like each day is your last, and yes it's cliche, but now I am haunted with this truth. Because it really could be. I used to think that even if I died that my music would last forever but that's another thing I am wrong about. The truth is the book of Revelations says that the stars will fall from the sky. Science tells us we are destroying our planet. Oblivion is nigh either way you look at it. There will be a day when we forget the names Ghandi, Eistein, Tupac and Michael Jordan. A day where Alexander the Great was just another guy named Alexander. Forgotten. So why does any of it matter?  Well to me, the same way that a beautiful sunset represents that something is ending. The same way this \"thing\" called \"life\" is ending. And it's beautiful. And sometimes we wish we could freeze a beautiful sunset and take one moment of our lives and make it last for eternity. And maybe we can... who the hell am I to say that you can't. But even if you can't I'm okay with that. I'm thankful I'm alive, I'm thankful I get to have this brief experience called \"Chris.\" So raise your glass, lets have a toast...\n\nTrack 19 from Dream State 2: Finding Flow State\nWritten,
