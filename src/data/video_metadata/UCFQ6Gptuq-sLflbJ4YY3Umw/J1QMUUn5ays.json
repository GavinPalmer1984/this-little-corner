 "description": "Erik Davis is an author, podcaster and award-winning journalist whose work explores the intersection of technology, counterculture and the esoteric. \n\nHis latest book, 'High Weirdness', explores the new counterculture of drugs, esoterica and visionary experience that emerged in the 1970's - spearheaded by three pioneering figures: Terence McKenna, Philip K Dick and Robert Anton Wilson. \n\nHe sat down with Rebel Wisdom's Alexander Beiner to discuss why the world is getting weirder, how to respond to it, and why the ideas of the 1970's counterculture are as relevant now as they were then.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
