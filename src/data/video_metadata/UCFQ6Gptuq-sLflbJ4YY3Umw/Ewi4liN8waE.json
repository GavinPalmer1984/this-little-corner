Fifty years after they broke up, it seems that the mark they made on our culture has not faded. Does this demonstrate the timeless genius of the band, or is it a sign of a culture that is stuck?\n\nA few days ago saw the release of an eight hour fly-on-the-wall documentary 'Get Back', made by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson. It shows some of their last sessions as they put together the album 'Let it Be', and culminated in their famous rooftop concert.\n\nErik Davis is the foremost historian of the counterculture, and Anderson Todd works in the Wisdom and Consciousness Lab at Toronto University. In this epic conversational riff they examine what was captured in The Beatles' music and why it resonates today. \n\nThis conversation was recorded in the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire. To join conversations like this check out our upcoming events: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events\n\nCheck out Erik's newsletter, The Burning Shore:
