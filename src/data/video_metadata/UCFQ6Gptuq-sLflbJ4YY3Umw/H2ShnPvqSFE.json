 "description": "What are the challenges facing men today? Former US Army Ranger and philosopher Michael Robillard looks at the growing sense of alienation felt by men and how to find a sense of belonging.\n\nJournalist and founder of the new men's movement Rebel Wisdom, David Fuller, describes how a deep personal story of reconciliation with his dying father led to him dedicating his life to men's work and personal growth.\n\nAnd Nathan Roberts, the head of the inspirational Band of Brothers network, will explain how they transform the lives of young men involved in the criminal justice system, and what their work shows about the crisis of young men in today's society.\n\nPanel discussion afterwards with philosopher Jules Evans.\n\nThis was a joint event between the London Philosophy Club and Rebel Wisdom.\n\nFor more videos, and events, see: http://rebelwisdom.co.uk/",
