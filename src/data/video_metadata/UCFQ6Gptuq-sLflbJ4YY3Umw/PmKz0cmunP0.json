 "description": "Ayishat Akanbi is a stylist and cultural commentator, her monologue 'The Problem with Wokeness' went viral a couple of years ago.\n\nShe argues that modern social justice movements, or 'wokeness', often creates division, and harms those it is intended to help.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, she talks about how she used to be an activist, but her perspective comes from a deep spiritual transformation she went through. She also talks about the paradox of wanting to get beyond the politics of identity, while knowing that her identity characteristics mean that her words are taken more seriously.\n\nLinks:\n\nThe Problem with Wokeness: https://youtu.be/_-WimRb2jXs\n\nAyishat's Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ayishat_Akanbi\n\nDavid's Twitter: https://twitter.com/fullydavid\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, and to join the growing Rebel Wisdom Community, become a member: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can listen to a podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/",
