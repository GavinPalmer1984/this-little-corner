 "description": "Coleman Cruz Hughes writes on the topic of race for Quillette and the New York Times. Despite still being an undergraduate, studying philosophy at Colombia University, his articles have sparked polarised reactions, leading to a meteoric rise in profile over the last couple of years. \n\nOn Tuesday 18th June, he gave evidence at the US congressional hearing about reparations for the legacy of slavery.\n\nIn this discussion with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, he explains what he makes of this newfound fame, and how much responsibility does he feel to use his words carefully on this explosive topic in America.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
