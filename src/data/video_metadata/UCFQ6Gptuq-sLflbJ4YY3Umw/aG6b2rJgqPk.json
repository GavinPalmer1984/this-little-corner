 "description": "This is part of Rebel Wisdom's Mediation Series. \n\nMatthew Taylor is the head of the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA), and has been at the centre of UK politics and culture for decades.\n\nHe first started focusing on the problem of polarisation and mediation a decade ago, and has seen the problem grow until it has become one of the dominant issues facing democracy. What lessons has he learned in that time? \n\nThis conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller covers the destructive impact of new technology, how politics itself is based on bad faith argumentation and how a cultural shift is needed to reverse course.\n\nMatthew Taylor's blog: https://www.thersa.org/blog/matthew-taylor/2019/09/understand\n\nRebel Wisdom's Sensemaking course launches again in February, check it out here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses",
