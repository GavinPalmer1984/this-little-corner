From the scenes in the US Capitol, Q Anon making the final leap from fringe conspiracy theory to the centre of American government, to the reaction of big tech, Twitter booting Donald Trump and the demise of Parler.\n\nIn this talk and Q&A for the Rebel Wisdom Community, David tries to tease out the complexities of the situation, and how multiple narratives are clashing, and the fracture of the information landscape.\n\nLinks to news stories and podcasts discussed in the film are below.\n\nRebel Wisdom's acclaimed course in understanding the world better, Sensemaking 101, is starting again in February, find out more here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses\n\nLINKS:\n\nJordan Hall, Situational Assessment 2017: Trump Edition:
