After his successful attempts to part people from their money through his scam 'Digital Freedom Platform' last year, he's now running for London Mayor.\n\nAfter becoming a laughing stock on YouTube, Brian is now determined to bring his failing personality cult to the capital's voters. He claims to be running in second place, and the main challenger to Mayor Sadiq Khan, but as can be expected by now with Brian, that's a lie. And it's not the only one.\n\nThis is a conversation between Coffeezilla, the expert in dodgy online gurus who has been tracking Brian for over a year, and Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller. \n\nDavid has just published an article for Unherd on this topic: https://unherd.com/2021/04/could-brian-rose-be-londons-next-mayor/\n\nCatch up on previous films covering the shameless Mr Rose here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/films/34-film-content/london-real-series\n\nAnd check out Coffeezilla's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQMnBA3CS502aghlcr0_aw\n\nRebel Wisdom has just relaunched
