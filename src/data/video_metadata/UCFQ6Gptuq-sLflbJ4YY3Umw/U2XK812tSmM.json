It's the name given to a group of alternative media personalities - from Joe Rogan to Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson. New York Times article here: \n\nBut could it also be a spontaneous emergence of a new - and more highly evolved - level of consciousness into the media landscape?\n\nThe Integral philosopher Ken Wilber has been predicting the emergence of a new way of thinking since the 90s - one that embraces paradox and nuance, and lets go of the ideology and fixed thinking of the past - an \"integral\" consciousness.\n\nHe believes that the Intellectual Dark Web is the start of a genuinely next level - or Integral - conversation.\n\nThis is one of several films with Ken Wilber on Rebel Wisdom.\n\nRebel Wisdom is a media platform making films about the biggest subjects.\n\nTo join the conversation, connect with other Rebellious Thinkers, and feed in questions for our next interviews, become a supporter: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nKen Wilber and his team have created a series on Jordan Peterson & the Intellectual Dark
