What does genuine conversation look like and how can we enter into a space of creative flow where the right answers emerge? Jordan Greenhall has spent many years thinking about this 'meta-conversation', and how, in these polarised and partisan times, it may just save the world. \n\nHe wrote the celebrated and viral 'Deep Code, Situational Assessment' post in the aftermath of the Trump election in 2017: https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046#.4e0d7rvwd\n\nThe first part of
