 "description": "Jordan Peterson and other members of the 'Intellectual Dark Web' have come in for heated criticism from fans, after Peterson suggested Brett Kavanaugh step down amid the controversy over his elevation to the supreme court. What's behind it, and what does it say about the most polarised political climate for many generations?\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform founded on the conviction that we are seeing an ongoing and growing civilisational crisis, and the old operating systems break down. We can no longer trust the traditional media to make sense of the world. The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nWe made the first full documentary about Jordan Peterson's ideas, and have recently released interviews with other members of the Intellectual Dark Web such as Douglas Murray: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXS8qkHlhrs&t=130s",
