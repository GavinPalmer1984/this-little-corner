He takes the words of the likes of Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink and others, and matches them with an inspiring musical backing - a new musican genre, Meaningwave was born.\n\nRebel Wisdom's David Fuller interviewed him back in March after he remixed our 'Glitch in the Matrix' documentary. He caught up with him again in LA in July to find out how the 'Meaningwave Universe' was developing.\n\nPrevious interview: Jordan Peterson, 21st century pop superstar.
