 "description": "The Canadian psychologist and celebrity Jordan Peterson recently broke his near-year long silence and descibed his debilitating illness as the result of benzodiazepine dependence.\n\nPeterson became ill simply as a result of following doctors' advice. What does that say about our society and culture, our media environment, and the state of psychiatric medicine.\n\nIn this Rebel Wisdom investigation, David Fuller talks to one of the world's leading investigators of the long term effects of psychiatric drugs, Robert Whitaker, a Pulitzer Prize shortlisted author.\n\nHe also links it to Eric Weinstein's concept of the DISC, or Distributed Idea Suppression Complex, to explore why the knowledge of the long term dangers of these drugs is not reflected in the media conversation.\n\nThe whole interview with Robert Whitaker is being released at the same time as this film: https://youtu.be/LQvN5aFcBr8\n\nRelevant links from the conversation:\n\nThe Mikhaila Peterson Podcast #9 - Jordan B.
