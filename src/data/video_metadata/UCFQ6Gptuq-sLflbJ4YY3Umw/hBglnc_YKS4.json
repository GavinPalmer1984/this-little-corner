 "description": "A couple of weeks ago Rebel Wisdom published an investigation into the fundraising of London Real in the aftermath of their banned interview with David Icke. This can be watched here: https://youtu.be/hDM1wTGOjOw\n\nThe channel Coffeezilla also covered the story.\n\nIn the aftermath of the interview both Rebel Wisdom and Coffeezilla were contacted by multiple people with knowledge of the events, and have continued to research the background. Here we talk through our findings and what we understand of the backstory.\n\nBrian Rose has been contacted ten times now and asked for a response to the questions and allegations in these films, and has not responded.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
