How can the human spirit survive in an age of weaponised disinformation, attention hijack and digital manipulation? Douglas Rushkoff has made these questions his life's mission, culminating in his recent \"mic drop\" moment, Team Human.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller he talks about the trajectory of silicon valley, from psychedelic tech utopianism, to corporate takeover and attention warfare.\n\nNamed one of the \u201cworld\u2019s ten most influential intellectuals\u201d by MIT, Douglas Rushkoff is an author and documentarian who studies human autonomy in a digital age. His twenty books include the just-published Team Human, based on his podcast, as well as the bestsellers Present Shock, Throwing Rocks and the Google Bus, Program or Be Programmed, Life Inc, and Media Virus. \n\nWe will be hosting a member's Q&A with Douglas next Monday, sign up as a Rebel Wisdom Sensemaker to join: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can listen to a podcast versions of our
