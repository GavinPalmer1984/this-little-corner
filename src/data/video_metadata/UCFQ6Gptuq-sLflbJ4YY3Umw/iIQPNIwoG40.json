Andrew Sweeny has written many articles examining Peterson's impact on the culture. In this Skype chat with David Fuller, director of two documentaries about Jordan Peterson, he explains how the reaction to Peterson is largely due to the way that Peterson is reviving a perspective that many thought had been banished forever.
