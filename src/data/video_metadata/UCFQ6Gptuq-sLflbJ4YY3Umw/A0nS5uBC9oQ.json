 "description": "A few months ago we put out a brilliant conversation about the deep mythology of the new Dune movie with the sci fi writer and podcaster Damien Walter - looking at what the stories we tell through science fiction tell us about who we are and where we're going.\n\nThis is a dialogue with the host of the Symbolic World, Jonathan Pageau, about the religious and mythological symbolism and role of sci fi. \n\nThey cover a vast amount of territory, from The Matrix to Star Trek, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg - and end by predicting the next stories we'll likely see over the next years.\n\nhttps://thesymbolicworld.com/\n\nhttps://damiengwalter.com/category/podcast/\n\nTo see all our written content, check out our new Substack, where you can also find our newly released free Sensemaking Companion: https://rebelwisdom.substack.com/\n\nOur groundbreaking Sensemaking 101 course is starting again in February: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses/sensemaking-101-page",
