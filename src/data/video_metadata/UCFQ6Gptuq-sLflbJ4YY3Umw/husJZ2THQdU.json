Since then Jordan Peterson's fame has grown exponentially, to the point where he is almost certainly the most polarising, and perhaps the most famous public intellectual in the world. Shortly after his debates with Sam Harris in London, David Fuller caught up with him again. This is their discussion. \n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media channel making films about the biggest ideas - the spearhead of a new counterculture.\n\nCheck out our other films and interviews like 'Glitch
