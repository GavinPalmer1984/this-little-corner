 "description": "The phenomenal success of Jordan Peterson has created hugely polarised reactions, most clearly on the left, or progressive side of the political divide.\n\nMatthew Tarnas Segall is a lecturer at the California Institute of Integral Studies, a highly progressive and spiritually influenced college in San Francisco, and Jesse Estrin is a depth psychotherapist*, a graduate of CIIS and has worked on causes for social justice for many years.\n\n*incorrectly called \"depth psychologist\" in the film.\n\nIn this four-way discussion with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller and Alexander Beiner, both are keen to examine the question of what the left can learn from Jordan Peterson, and to ask why much of 'their tribe' has such a strong reaction to his thought. \n\nJesse, Matthew and a colleague, Adam, put out their own podcast about Jordan Peterson and the left: \"The Jordan Peterson Moment: Seeking Dialogue on the Left\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccaf7fEWtB4\n\nRebel Wisdom Discord Chat: https://discord.gg/rJtyfFV\ufeff\n\nThis film is part of a larger Rebel Wisdom series, \"Jordan Peterson and the left, a new conversation\". The other films are as follows.\n\n'Jordan Peterson and the left' with brand new Jordan Peterson interview: https://youtu.be/6sUtOOOVcqw\n\n'Jordan Peterson, censorship and the left', with novelist Tim Lott: https://youtu.be/yRmvzqc8BkU\n\n'Jordan Peterson and Integral Theory', with Jeff Salzman of the Daily Evolver: https://youtu.be/hfJbrS75_Gs\n\n'Jordan Peterson and the patriarchy', with Lene Andersen: https://youtu.be/dvyo1w5Ff_A\n\n'Beyond polarisation?'
