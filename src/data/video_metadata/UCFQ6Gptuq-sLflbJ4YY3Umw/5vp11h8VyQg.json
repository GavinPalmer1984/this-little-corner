 "description": "Jordan Peterson explains why men in particular are hungry for the messages in his lectures: \"You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility ... and then the question is what are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility. And the answer might be well maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life.\"\n\nMany thanks to Jordan Peterson for the content - we are running events based on many of the insights of his lectures - see: www.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nOriginal video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4fjSrVCDvA&index=11&list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h",
