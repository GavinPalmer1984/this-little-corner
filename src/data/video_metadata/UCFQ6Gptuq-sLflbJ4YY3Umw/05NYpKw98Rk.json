 "description": "Paul Kingsnorth is one of the most interesting voices wrestling with the deepest questions of modernity, religion and the spiritual void in western culture.\n\nA former pagan - and long time environmentalist - a couple of years ago he had a completely unexpected conversion to Christianity, which he outlined in his fascinating piece The Cross and the Machine: https://www.firstthings.com/article/2021/06/the-cross-and-the-machine\n\nIn this conversation in Rebel Wisdom's Digital Campfire we discussed his journey, and reflected on the deep Christian story that we're all immersed in in the west - and if it's even possible to move outside it?\n\nTo join conversations like this, check out our membership options: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nCheck out Paul's newsletter, The Abbey of Misrule: https://paulkingsnorth.substack.com/",
