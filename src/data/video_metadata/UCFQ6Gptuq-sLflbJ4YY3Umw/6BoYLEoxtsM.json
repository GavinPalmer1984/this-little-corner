 "description": "What are we getting wrong with Covid, and what does it mean to adapt to it becoming an endemic disease?\n\nWilliam Eden is a biotech and healthcare expert who has been paying close attention to the progress of the pandemic from many different angles. \n\nHe recently posted a viral Twitter thread on the topic: https://twitter.com/WilliamAEden/status/1470271294398558210\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller they cover how the pandemic became politicised, how the authorities have been slow to adapt, and how the mandates are likely to backfire.\n\nTo join conversations and practice sessions with some of the world's top facilitators, check out becoming a Rebel Wisdom member: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events\n\nWe're running our groundbreaking course in better Sensemaking, with guest faculty including John Vervaeke, Sara Ness, Diane Musho Hamilton and Daniel Schmachtenberger, starting in February 2022, fond out more and join here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses/sensemaking-101-page\n\nWe've also just created a new self-study course called Essential Philosophy for Modern Life with Jules Evans.
