Polarisation has been growing for decades, and supercharged by social media filter bubbles.\n\nThis is the first in a series of films from Rebel Wisdom looking at the science and psychology of polarisation.\n\nWe speak to Alex Evans, a former government adviser now looking at the roots of division through the Collective Psychology Project: https://www.collectivepsychology.org/\n\nAlso to superstar trauma specialists Dr Stephen Porges, Peter Levine, Gina Ross and Steve Haines about how our nervous system is intimately involved in assessing safety and threat, and how that underlies all conflict and polarisation. \n\nWe will be releasing one of these films each Thursday in August. However, supporters can see them immediately in the members area of our website. To get immediate access to the full interviews with Dr Stephen Porges and Peter Levine, and to help us make more of these films, please consider becoming a supporter: www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nExtracts also from: Deep Code with Jordan Green(Hall): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j3cCrpXERg\n\nHacking Collective Intelligence, Jamie Wheal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtdJy87z0Ys&t=483s\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
