Gabor Mat\u00e9 is an world famous expert on addiction - in his book 'In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts' he talks about how addiction is best viewed not as a crime or illness but as a coping mechanism for a personal, spiritual crisis.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with Rebel Wisdom he talks about how social media has created a whole new area for addictive behaviour, how traumatised leaders have created unhealthy societies and what he makes of the internet sensation and fellow Canadian intellectual Jordan Peterson.\n\nTo see the second part of the interview, 'Addiction and psychedelic therapy', and many other great films, become a Rebel Wisdom patron: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\nGabor Mat\u00e9's book 'In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts' has just been released in the UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Realm-Hungry-Ghosts-Encounters-Addiction-ebook/dp/B07CJNMY2H/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1542386683&sr=8-3&keywords=gabor+mate\n\nThe next instalment of 'Rebel Wisdom Live' will be 'Divided Brain, Divided World' with Iain McGilchrist in London on November 20th at 7pm GMT.
