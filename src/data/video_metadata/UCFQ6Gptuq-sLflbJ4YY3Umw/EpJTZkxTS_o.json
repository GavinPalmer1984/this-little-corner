It can also be applied to helping us navigate disagreement and regulate our own nervous systems. \n\nIn the first episode of our new show The Wisdom Gym, Levine shares insights from his decades of experience with a live audience of Rebel Wisdom members. We explore where Somatic Experience came from, why it matters now and how we can apply it in day to day life.\n\nOur next Wisdom Gym guest is Dr Gabor Mate on Wednesday, 26 January at 3pm EST / 12pm PST / 8pm GMT.
