His latest book, 'Woke Racism', is a full frontal attack on what he considers to be a new hidden racism, coming from the left. \n\nIn Woke Racism, McWhorter outlines the workings of what he believes is a new religion, from the original sin of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and the weaponization of cancel culture to ban heretics, to the evangelical fervor of the \u201cwoke mob.\u201d He shows how this religion that claims to \u201cdismantle racist structures\u201d is actually harming his fellow Black Americans by infantilizing Black people, setting Black students up for failure, and passing policies that disproportionately damage Black communities. The new religion might be called \u201cantiracism,\u201d but it features a racial essentialism that\u2019s barely distinguishable from racist arguments of the past.\n\nThis was a conversation in Rebel
