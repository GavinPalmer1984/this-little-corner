 "description": "What can we say for sure about YouTube's effect on political radicalisation? Why were so many heterodox channels being wrongly categorised as \"Far Right\" in a recent academic study?\n\nAfter the academics in the study accepted a mistake and apologised, Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller spoke to researcher Mark Ledwich, the creator of Transparency Tube, to understand what was going on.\n\nTransparency.Tube: https://transparency.tube/\n\nThis is a follow up to the recent film 'WTF is Going On? If Everything is Far Right, then Nothing Is': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISpbtbbvHQ&t=9s\n\nIf you'd like to help Rebel Wisdom continue to make films, consider becoming a member: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
