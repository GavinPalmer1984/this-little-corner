But what is collective intelligence, how do we use it, and why does it matter so much right now?\n\nThis is the introduction to Rebel Wisdom's new series on Collective Intelligence.\n\nThe other films in the series include a trialogue between Jordan (Green)Hall, Jamie Wheal and Daniel Schmachtenberger, 'Making Sense of Sensemaking' (Premiere on 4 September): https://youtu.be/0xSUw_QhJkc \n\nAnd Circling for Collective Intelligence, with founder of the conversational practice of Circling, Guy Sengstock (Coming Soon)\n\nExpress your interest in the Rebel Wisdom Collective Intelligence Lab in
