 "description": "Jordan Peterson has gone from an obscure Canadian academic to an intellectual megastar in a little over a year, and become one of the most polarising cultural figures. \n\nAt the core, his philosophical project involves tying together mythology, religion and science into a 'theory of everything' that many are finding compelling.\n\nThe Integral philosopher Ken Wilber did something similar in the 90s and 2000s, and built a large and passionate following.\n\nWhat does he make of Jordan Peterson's rise to fame? Where does he agree, and disagree with his philosophy?\n\nHe sat down with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller to explain.\n\nThis is one of several films with Ken Wilber on Rebel Wisdom. Including 'The Intellectual Dark Web, an Integral Conversation?': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2XK812tSmM&t=317s\n\nTo get access to the entire uncut 4 hour interview, become a supporter: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nSupporters can also join the conversation, connect with other Rebellious Thinkers, and feed in questions for our next interviews.\n\nKen Wilber and his team have created a series on Jordan Peterson & the Intellectual Dark Web:\nhttps://integrallife.com/whats-missing-in-the-intellectual-dark-web/#",
