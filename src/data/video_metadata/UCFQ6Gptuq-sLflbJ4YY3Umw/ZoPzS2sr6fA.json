 "description": "Alex Evans was a government adviser for many years, consulting on some of the biggest challenges facing society. He became disillusioned at how little attention was paid to the underlying narratives of change, to psychology, and to growing polarisation. \n\nHe's now created the collective psychology project, to begin to address these deeper issues: https://www.collectivepsychology.org/\n\nThis is one of a series of films from Rebel Wisdom looking at the science and psychology of polarisation. We recommend to start with the introduction film here: https://youtu.be/EUNHj5eh7BM\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
