What's Going On?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZHZHygS3Es", "date": "2020-08-05", "description": "Since the start of the pandemic there has been an exponential growth in all-encompassing conspiracy narratives, with the viral success of the 'Plandemic' documentary trailer being the most popular example.\n\nIn particular we have seen traditional right wing conspiracy narratives combine with traditional left wing alternative, spiritual communities. \n\nWhat is this new phenomenon, and what is causing it?\n\nIn this film in Rebel Wisdom's Sensemaking series we try to understand the nexus between spirituality and conspiracy thinking.\n\nPlaylist for the Sensemaking Series is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCA7IL3lkxbKVfUTc5k6reae8lHTDSZXO\n\nLink to Spiritual Emergency book by Jules Evans and Tim Read: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Breaking-Open-Finding-Spiritual-Emergencies/dp/1912807696\n\n'Conspirituality', by Jules Evans:
