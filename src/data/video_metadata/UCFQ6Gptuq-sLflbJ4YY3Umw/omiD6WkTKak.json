 "description": "A few hours ago, Rebel Wisdom published an investigation into London Real's 'Digital Freedom Platform', a crowdfunder that has raised nearly $1m to pay to stream content banned by the major tech platforms. We asked why many of the claims about the platform fail to add up.\n\nAt around the same time, YouTube deleted the channel of the veteran conspiracy researcher David Icke.\n\nWhy did they do that?\n\nThis is an update to Rebel Wisdom's Investigation. Watch that first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDM1wTGOjOw&t=1527s",
