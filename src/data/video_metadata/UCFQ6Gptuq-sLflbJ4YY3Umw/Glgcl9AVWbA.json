In 2013, Jim Rutt brought together a group of thinkers from different fields to work on the biggest of all problems. In time it developed a name, 'Game~B'.\n\nThe in-person project ran into the ground after a year, but continued as an online meeting place. \n\nRecently there has been a new wave of interest in the term. What can be learned from the story of the original project?\n\nNote: These interviews are from 2019, and were intended for a larger film about Game B, with more interviews with the original members - it is being published now in an incomplete form. Apologies to those not featured.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page:
