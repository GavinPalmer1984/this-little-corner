In this interview he discusses the origin of the book and the response to it, particularly his disappointment that few reviewers were able to refute his central point.\n\nStrange Death of Europe: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strange-Death-Europe-Immigration-Identity/dp/1472942248\n\nThis film was recorded in 2018, and was a member exclusive until now.
