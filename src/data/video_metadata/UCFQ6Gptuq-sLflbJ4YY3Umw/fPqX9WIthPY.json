 "description": "A couple of months ago, Rebel Wisdom put out a series of investigations into London Real and interviewer Brian Rose's new 'Digital Freedom Platform'.\n\nNow London Real have filed several fraudulent copyright claims and forced YouTube to take them down. \n\nThis is a serious matter that shows how bad actors can use YouTube's terms of service to evade scrutiny. It goes to the heart of the original concerns about censorship and the big tech platforms. \n\nRebel Wisdom has put the original investigation onto Bitchute: https://www.bitchute.com/video/HQzjhqLLWLwF/\n\nAnd hosted on our website: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nThe films that have been taken down are:\n\nLondon Real/David Icke, Investigation Update (Removed/Copyright Strike).\n\nLondon Real Investigation: https://youtu.be/hDM1wTGOjOw\n\nLondon Real Update, Coffeezilla & Rebel Wisdom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBglnc_YKS4\n\nThere is also a Medium article on the controversy 'Cashing in on Covid' here: https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/cashing-in-on-covid-london-real-david-icke-c4cac9f897dc\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/\n\nTo support Rebel Wisdom, and get member benefits including regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
