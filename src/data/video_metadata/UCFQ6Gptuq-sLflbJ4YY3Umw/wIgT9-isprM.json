 "description": "Over the last year, Heather Heying and her husband Bret Weinstein have turned their podcast the Dark Horse, into a commentary on the pandemic.\n\nIt's a long way from their background as evolutionary biology professors at Evergreen college, which they were forced to leave in 2017. \n\nHow has the journey been over the last year, and what can be learnt from it? \n\nThis Q&A was recorded in April in the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire. To see upcoming events, and join conversations like this, check here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events\n\nDark Horse podcast is here: https://www.youtube.com/BretWeinsteinDarkHorse",
