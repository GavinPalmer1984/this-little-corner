Jamie lays out 3 different approaches people are using to ensure psychedelic culture keeps its transformative potential: working within the existing game to change it, finding creative ways to jam it up, or playing an entirely new game. \n\nYou can watch the first part of this conversation 'Endgame for the Psychedelic Renaissance?' here: https://youtu.be/EOXJOZK1ZNQ\n\nJamie Wheal's new book, 'Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex, and Death in a World That's Lost Its Mind' comes out on April 27th: https://www.amazon.com/Recapture-Rapture-Rethinking-Death-World/dp/0062905465/\n\nBecome a Rebel Wisdom member to participate in live Q&A calls with guests like Jamie Wheal.
