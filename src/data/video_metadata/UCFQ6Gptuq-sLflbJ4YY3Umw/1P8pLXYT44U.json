 "description": "The pandemic crisis has created what researcher Carl Miller has called the \"biggest moment for conspiracy narratives in history\". What draws us to them, and why do they inspire such passion and certainty?\n\nIn this film, Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller talks to psychology professor John Vervaeke, philosophy author Jules Evans and Carl Miller, to try to understand a deeper level of conspiracy thinking. \n\nAlso check out the recent 'War on Sensemaking, Pandemic & Conspiracy': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3075s\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
