We catch\u00a0up with the faculty of our online course, Sensemaking 101, to find out what questions they've been\u00a0wresting with recently.\n\nWe also discuss how we think the information landscape has shifted in the last\u00a06 months, reflect on the challenges of figuring out how to navigate the complexity and weirdness of 2021, and share which practices we've found essential in improving agency,\u00a0sovereignty and discernment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSensemaking 101 has an average rating of 90% from over a thousand alumni. Our next course starts on July 8 - read more and book your place on www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/sensemaking101\u00a0\n\nIf you aren't able to afford the course right now, we offer discounted scholarship places.
