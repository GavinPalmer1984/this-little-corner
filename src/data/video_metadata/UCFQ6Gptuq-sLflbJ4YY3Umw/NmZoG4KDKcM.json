 "description": "In the middle of the 19th century, the Nordic Countries were some of the poorest in Europe, with the lowest quality of life. By the end of the century they were some of the wealthiest and best places to live in the world.\n\nWhy and how? According to philosopher and social entrepreneur Tomas Bj\u00f6rkman, the reason is that they paid attention to inner development, more than outer growth, in a huge cultural project of personal growth.\n\nHe argues that the pace of change that we are going through now requires a similar focus on the techniques of development.\n\nRead more about The Nordic Secret here: https://www.nordicsecret.org/ and its primary author Lene Rachel Andersen.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
