The left & Jordan Peterson', with Ronan Harrington, Alter Ego", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Fwhs3HBGE", "date": "2018-08-01", "description": "Jordan Peterson has become one of the polarising public figures in the world, especially to those on the left of the political spectrum. But especially given that the left seems to be losing ground around the world, is there something that people on the left can learn from him? And how can we even have that conversation in a hot tempered political climate that seemed fuelled by the need to cast instant judgement on people and ideas. \n\nIs the left ready to have the conversation, if not, why not?\n\nRonan Harrington is from a very progressive political culture, and released a film recently comparing Jordan Peterson and Russell Brand for his channel, Alter Ego. Film here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XqvddgtkGM\n\nRebel Wisdom Discord Chat: https://discord.gg/rJtyfFV\ufeff\n\nRonan and David Fuller (Rebel Wisdom) discuss what is inspiring and challenging about Jordan Peterson, and try to unpack why the left seems to be in such crisis around the world.\n\nHe discusses with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller about what he finds challenging about Jordan Peterson.\n\nThis film is part of a larger Rebel Wisdom series, \"Jordan Peterson and the left, a new conversation\". The other films are as follows.\n\nMain discussion with new Jordan Peterson interview: https://youtu.be/6sUtOOOVcqw\n\n'Jordan Peterson, censorship and the left', with novelist Tim Lott:
