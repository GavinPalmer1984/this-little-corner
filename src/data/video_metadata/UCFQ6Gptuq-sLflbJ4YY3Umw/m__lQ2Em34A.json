It was coined by the psychologist Stan Grof in the 1970s.\n\nDr Tim Read is a leading psychiatrist and is also trained as a holotropic breathwork practitioner with Stan Grof. He was Consultant at the Royal London Hospital for over twenty years leading the Liaison Psychiatry service and the Crisis Intervention service. \n\nIn this discussion with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, they talk about the phenomenon of spiritual emergency and how to navigate in altered states. \n\nTim will be doing an open Q&A for all Rebel Wisdom members on Wednesday 9th December.
