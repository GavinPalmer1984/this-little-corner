 "description": "Jordan Peterson is often described as doing for the western religious tradition, what Alan Watts did for the East in the 50s and 60s, explaining and demystifying it for a new audience.\n\nTim Lott is a novelist and journalist, who wrote the first mainstream magazine article on Jordan Peterson in 2017. He is also an expert on Alan Watts. In this film he discusses with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller and Alexander Beiner about the similarities and differences between them.\n\nThis film was recorded in 2018, and was a member exclusive until now.
