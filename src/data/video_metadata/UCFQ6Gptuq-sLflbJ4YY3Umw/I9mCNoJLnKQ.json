 "description": "The loose affiliation of alternative media personalities called the Intellectual Dark Web was partly formed through appearances on the Rubin Report.\n\nWhere is the IDW at now, where is it going, and is there a crossover point between alternative and mainstream media?\n\nAnd also - how does Dave Rubin answer the criticism that he is giving cover to some unpalatable characters on the right by framing them as less extreme than they actually are?\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store! Buy T Shirts and more on https://shop.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
