In this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, he argues that this conception doesn't go far enough, and that the conversation - begun this summer in the live events with Sam Harris - needs to continue.\n\nClip taken from The Rubin Report, 'Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro: Religion, Trans Activism, and Censorship': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1opHWsHr798\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform
