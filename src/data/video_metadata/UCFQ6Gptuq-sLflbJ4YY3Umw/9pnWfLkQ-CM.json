 "description": "Mary recently took part in Rebel Wisdom's first 'Sex and Culture' event, where there was a great deal of interest in her concept of 'reactionary feminism'. \n\nShe returns to Rebel Wisdom for a showcase event in our Digital Campfire, in dialogue with Raven Connolly. She says: \"The central contention of reactionary feminism is that the ideas of 'freedom' and 'progress' themselves are now delivering diminishing returns for all but a shrinking elite. And this is impacting especially severely on women, meaning that in order to remain true to the central task of feminism - advocating for women's political interests - feminists must turn against the theology of progress.\"\n\nTo join live and take part in conversations like this one, in Rebel Wisdom's Digital Campfire, check out the upcoming sessions here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events\n\nMary is a writer and journalist. After graduating from Oxford University in 2002 with a first-class degree in English Literature, she was an early adopter of millennial precarity, via a twenties spent experimenting with gig economy work, intentional communities, gender nonconformity and unconventional relationship forms.\n\nAlong the way she discovered digital culture and web 2.0, co-founding the digital learning marketplace \u2018School of Everything\u2019; working as a researcher with the New York-based digital culture think tank \u2018The Institute for the Future of the Book\u2019; and curating cult art events.\n\nAfter the crash of 2008 she worked in marketing while training as a psychotherapist, before discovering marriage, motherhood and small town life - along with an audience as a writer via her political blog. Her writing has been published by the New Statesman, The Spectator and Mail on Sunday, and she is a contributing editor at the influential online magazine UnHerd.",
