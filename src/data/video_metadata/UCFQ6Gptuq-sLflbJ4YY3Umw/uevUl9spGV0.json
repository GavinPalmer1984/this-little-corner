The influence of science fiction on culture seems stronger than ever - but why does it matter? \n\nIn this conversation in the Rebel Wisdom digital campfire, Alexander Beiner talks with sci-fi expert Damien Walter - star of our recent film 'Dune & The Deeper Meaning of Sci-Fi' and host of the host of the Science Fiction Podcast. The conversation explores just how influential science fiction has been on Silicon Valley, what sci-fi myths can tell us about ourselves, and what we can learn from our most out there visions of utopia and dystopia.\n\nJoin conversations like these in the Digital Campfire by becoming a member on www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans \n\nCheck out our first film with Damien, 'Dune & The Deeper Meaning of Sci-Fi' here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpLAcewRBSE\n\nCheck out Damien's work on https://damiengwalter.com/", "duration": 3555, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "welcome everyone to this uh
