 "description": "Why do some people see things that others don't? Julia Galef believes that it's because they're using what she calls Scout Mindset.\n\n\"It\u2019s what allows you to recognize when you were wrong, to seek out your blind spots, to test your assumptions and change course. It\u2019s what prompts you to honestly ask yourself questions like \u201cWas I at fault in that argument?\u201d or \u201cIs this risk really worth it?\u201d As the physicist Richard Feynman said: \u201cThe first rule is that you must not fool yourself \u2013 and you are the easiest person to fool.\u201d\"\n\nJulia Galef is one of the most prominent members of the Rationalist community, and co-founded the influential Centre for Applied Rationality (CFAR). Her website is: https://juliagalef.com/\n\nTo help us make more films like these and join calls with our worldwide community, check out membership options here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
