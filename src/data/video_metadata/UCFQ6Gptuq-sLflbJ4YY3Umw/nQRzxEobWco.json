Rebel Wisdom looks at the growing civilisation-level crisis that we are beginning to see around us, and looks at what a genuine 'phase shift' for human progress might look like.\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nRebel Wisdom is running workshops for men and women to get a direct experience of the ideas in our films:
