 "description": "Cassie Jaye is the director of the Red Pill Movie, and Patricia Marcossia made 'The Rise of Jordan Peterson'. Both made films about controversial subjects and had run ins with 'cancel culture'. For Cassie Jaye that meant protests around her film about the men's rights movement, Patricia's film 'Rise' had showings cancelled at cinemas in North America.\n\nIn this three way discussion with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, they talk about the similarities and differences between their films, the experience of making them, and the controversy they both encountered when releasing them.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
