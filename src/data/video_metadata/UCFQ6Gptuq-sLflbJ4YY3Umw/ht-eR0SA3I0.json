 "description": "In the last few days the NPC (non-player character) meme has broken free of social media and made its way into the mainstream. Why has it spread so fast, and how does it relate to Jordan Greenhall's concept of 'thinking vs simulated thinking'.\n\nRelevant links:\n\nJordan Greenhall, 'Thinking vs Simulated Thinking': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOA_BZdG4X8&t=654s\n\nJordan Greenhall, 'Deep Code, Situational Assessment 2017: Trump Edition': https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046\n\nRebel Wisdom, 'Genuine Conversation and the Intellectual Dark Web': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQGksc1I7rA&t=598s\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform asking the biggest questions: http://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nTo discuss the ideas in our films, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW\n\nTo see more great films, and to help us make more, please consider becoming a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom",
