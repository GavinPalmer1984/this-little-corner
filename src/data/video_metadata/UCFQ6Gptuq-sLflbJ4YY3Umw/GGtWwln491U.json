 "date": "2020-06-26",
 "description": "Over two years ago the New York Times reported on \"a group of heretics, making an end run around the national conversation\", the Intellectual Dark Web.\n\nSince then the concept has been celebrated and criticised in equal measure. Rebel Wisdom talks to the man who came up with the name, mathematician Eric Weinstein, about the web and its critics. What has been learned since 2018?\n\nThis interview was conducted in April 2020.\n\nThis film is part of Rebel Wisdom's Sensemaking Series, see part 1, 'What the F*ck is Going On?' here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkKnOEQlwl4\n\nPart 2 is: My Journey with Jordan Peterson & the Intellectual Dark Web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXpWIephX1o\n\nAnd Part 3: The Death of Journalism? Jesse Singal & Katie Herzog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9AVo3jXjN8\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/\n\nTo support Rebel Wisdom, and get member benefits including regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
