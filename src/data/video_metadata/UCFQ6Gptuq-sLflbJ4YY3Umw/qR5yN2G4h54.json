 "description": "Sex and gender is one of the most fraught topics in the resurgence of the culture wars. Jordan Peterson has become something of a lightning rod for this debate.\n\nFellow member of the 'Intellectual Dark Web', evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein explains where both the left and right get evolutionary theory wrong - the blind spots on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n(This was recorded in May 2018)\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nHelp us make more of these films and get access to excellent exclusive films for Patrons by supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\nFind us on iTunes and Spotify, or visit rebelwisdom.podbean.com to download Rebel Wisdom as an audio podcast.",
