Recognizing that not everyone will have access to great internet to access some of these, I encourage you to apply these offline as well as online. Please be aware: there is a lot of disinformation  online, as always: be sure to triple check resources and the source. Ironically, most of the resources here come from survivors and those marginalized by state violence, so in a sense, prepared to respond to a crisis when there\u2019s no social safety net.\"\n\n'How Can I Help?' - list of online resources (concentrated on SF Bay area): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQlAmgIsXdEUdISa3gKYd5PX6eq6nc5WALdmNxQpNGw/edit?goal=0_69268eb282-f13cc4d023-21367745&mc_cid=f13cc4d023#gid=0 \n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nRebel Wisdom are now running regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
