 "description": "Rafia Morgan has been a facilitator and counsellor for over 40 years, and is something of a mentor to us at Rebel Wisdom.\n\nIn this wide ranging conversation with David Fuller, they discuss the positives and the pitfalls of awakening, and the huge shifts that have taken place in personal growth work since it first broke through to mainstream awareness in the 1960s.\n\nDavid's talk about his father's death they mention is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n_fi9iXxP8&t=1s\n\nRafia and his co-facilitator Turiya Hanover are shortly starting a new online course covering many of the topics discussed in this film, called Dimensions of Being. To see some free video material, check it out here: https://dimensions-of-being.teachable.com/p/initiation-into-essence?affcode=1027866_g66oefx9",
