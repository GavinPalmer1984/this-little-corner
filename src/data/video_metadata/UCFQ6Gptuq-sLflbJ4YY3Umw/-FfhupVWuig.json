If we can't agree on what is true, how can we even begin to solve any of the other problems we are facing.\n\nIn the first film in the series 'What the F*ck is Going On', a month ago, we looked at the growing crisis in journalism. The crisis has continued to accelerate in the last few weeks.\n\nIn this edition, Rebel Wisdom founder, journalist David Fuller speaks to Jesse Singal from the Blocked and Reported podcast, and also brings in new material with Bret Weinstein, and frameworks to understand what's happening from Jordan Hall.\n\nFollow David Fuller on Twitter: https://twitter.com/fullydavid\n\nLinks:\n\nHarpers Letter: https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\n\nBari Weiss resignation letter: https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter\n\nBlocked and Reported Podcast: https://www.patreon.com/blockedandreported\n\nArticle: \"The Reaction to the Harper's Letter on Cancel Culture Proves Why It Was Necessary\": https://reason.com/2020/07/08/the-reaction-to-the-harpers-letter-on-cancel-culture-proves-why-it-was-necessary/\n\nFilms:\n\nSensemaking Series Introduction, What the F*ck is Going On?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkKnOEQlwl4&t=12s\n\nThe Death of Journalism?
