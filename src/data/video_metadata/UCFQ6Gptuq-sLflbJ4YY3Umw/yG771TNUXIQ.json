 "description": "How can we make sense of the enormous changes going on in the landscape right now, as the growing crisis uproots everything we thought we knew.\n\nRebel Wisdom recently brought out a series of films about conspiracy and sensemaking, around the recent David Icke interviews on the channel London Real. They caused a huge, and hugely polarised reaction.\n\nIn this inquiry with Peter Limberg of the Intellectual Explorer's Club, Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller explores the topics raised by the films, and tries to make sense of the deeper questions they raise.\n\nDavid Icke & London Real, an Investigation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDM1wTGOjOw&t=1003s\n\nPeter Limberg's new Stoa project: https://www.thestoa.ca/\n\nCheck out Rebel Wisdom's recent film 'War on Sensemaking 4, Pandemic and Conspiracy': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qt...\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
