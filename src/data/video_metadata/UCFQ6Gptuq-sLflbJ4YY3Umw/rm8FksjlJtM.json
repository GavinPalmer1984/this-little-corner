The video has just been published from the long-awaited discussion between evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and Bret Weinstein in Chicago in October.\n\nIn it, they explore vital disagreements about key issues in evolution, in particular the role of belief structures such as religion. Dawkins famously describes them as 'mind viruses' while Weinstein claims that this is not the case.\n\nRebel Wisdom's David Fuller sat down with Bret Weinstein to discuss the debate and its fundamental importance to our understanding of human evolution.\n\nFull debate online here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzU-DoEV6k&t=1828s\n\nTo see Bret's analysis of his proposed debate with David Sloan Wilson, head over to his Patreon channel: https://www.patreon.com/bretweinstein/posts\n\nJust uploaded - another interview with Bret Weinstein, 'Jordan Peterson, gender and ideology' -
