 "description": "Does the response to the Jeffrey Epstein story, and the tale of the broken mice mean that journalism is broken? \n\nRecently Bret and Eric Weinstein put out a hugely popular podcast about a scientific discovery that calls into question the entire process of drug safety ('All Our Mice Are Broken' Episode 19 of The Portal).\n\nThey say that over 20 years of trying to get interest in this story, the response from the medical and media establishment has been silence. Eric has termed this phenomenon the Distributed Idea Suppression Complex, or DISC.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, Bret and Eric lay out the story of the broken mice, and the response to their conversation, and also discuss the unanswered questions at the heart of the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nPortal episode 19: 'All Our Mice Are Broken': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLb5hZLw44s&t=998s\nPortal episode 18: 'Slipping the DISC': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxnkGymKuuI\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nRebel Wisdom are now running regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
