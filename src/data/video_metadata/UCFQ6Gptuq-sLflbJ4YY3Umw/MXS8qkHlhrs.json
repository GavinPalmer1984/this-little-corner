 "description": "In Douglas Murray's recent bestseller, The Strange Death of Europe, he diagnoses a widespread cultural crisis in Europe, a continent that has fundamentally lost faith in itself. He is also part of the new loose grouping of public intellectuals known as the 'Intellectual Dark Web'. This interview with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller covers his disgnosis of western culture, the aims of the Intellectual Dark Web and his reflections on the recent high profile live events between himself, Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson.\n\nStrange Death of Europe: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strange-Death-Europe-Immigration-Identity/dp/1472942248\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform founded on the conviction that we are seeing an ongoing and growing civilisational crisis, and the old operating systems break down. We can no longer trust the traditional media to make sense of the world. The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nTo have early access to the second part of this interview, \"I wish I was wrong about The Strange Death of Europe\", and to help us make more of these films please consider becoming a Rebel Wisdom Patron: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\nDownload an audio version of this interview on iTunes, Spotify or direct from https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com",
