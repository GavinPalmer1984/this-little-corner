 "description": "How do we have difficult conversations?\n\nBret Weinstein and Heather Heying became the most high profile victims of campus activism, after they were driven out of Evergreen College in Washington State, USA.\n\nRecently they have become inaugural members of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web. The aim of the IDW is to have difficult conversations in public.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller they explain how their experience at Evergreen has informed their understanding of 'thinking in public'.\n\nFor access to exclusive member-only content, and to join the conversation - become part of the Rebel Wisdom community - go to: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can also support us via bitcoin here: 3DGbLDVxcYe9QQqhUKhYEKs3oTGBVZsEZt\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nWe also run weekend retreats for men: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/retreats",
