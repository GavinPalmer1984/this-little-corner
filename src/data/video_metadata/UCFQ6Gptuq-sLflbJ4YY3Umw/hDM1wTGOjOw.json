In it he claimed that Covid-19 was \"a hoax\" and that 5G was designed for a \"mass cull\". YouTube took it down.\n\nIn the wake of this the owner of London Real, Brian Rose launched a crowdfunding campaign for what he called the \"Digital Freedom Platform\". This has raced to nearly $1m in just over a week.\n\nHowever, lots of the claims about the platform don't appear to add up. This is an investigation into the platform, the wider issue of free speech and the censorship of the big tech platforms.\n\nDocuments and articles referenced in the film include:\n\nLondon Real
