 "description": "How can we make sense of the world together, and what stops us from doing so? \n\nMany of the thinkers we've interviewed on Rebel Wisdom talk about the importance of creating coherent sensemaking - or 'collective intelligence'. \n\nJamie Wheal is one of the world's top experts on flow, the author of the bestseller \"Stealing Fire\".\n\nIn this interview he explains the challenges of getting into flow with each other, and how to hack our bodies and minds to enter into that space.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
