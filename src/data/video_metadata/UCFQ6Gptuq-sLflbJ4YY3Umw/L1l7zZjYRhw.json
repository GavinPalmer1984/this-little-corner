 "description": "The UK election has delivered a landslide win for the right-wing Conservatives, and the biggest defeat for the left-wing Labour party since 1935.\r\n\nWhat caused it? Why has the left gone down to so many defeats recently, and what would they need to do to change it.\n\nThis discussion between Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller and Alexander Beiner references many Rebel Wisdom films, including:\n\nConflict & Collective Intelligence, Diane Musho Hamilton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVSm7XYlnnw&t=36s\r\n\nGlitch in the Matrix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhTbEs2GGE&t=278s\r\n\nKen Wilber, the Intellectual Dark Web, an Integral Conversation? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2XK812tSmM&t=773s\r\n\nA Zen Master talks about Jordan Peterson and the Shadow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABWeA203Q-c&t=1475s\r\n\nAnd references this article by David Hirsh, The Corbyn left: the politics of position and the politics of reason: http://fathomjournal.org/the-corbyn-left-the-politics-of-position-and-the-politics-of-reason/\r\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \r\n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
