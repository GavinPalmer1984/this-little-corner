 "description": "The music of James contains one of the most complete records of the process of spiritual transformation in music. But until now, the author of these lyrics has not shared where his inspiration came from.\n\nWhile most of the band's contemporaries in late 80s Manchester such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays were fuelled by hedonism and ecstasy, singer Tim Booth was deep in hardcore spiritual practice.\n\nIn this full and frank conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, Tim explains the full backstory for the first time.\n\nThere is a Medium article alongside this film with links to many of the band's songs referenced in the film: https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/music-and-transformation-tim-booth-james-93d4925d5832\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/\n\nTo support Rebel Wisdom, and get member benefits including regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
