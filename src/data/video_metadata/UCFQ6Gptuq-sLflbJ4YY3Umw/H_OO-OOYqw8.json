 "description": "A short film based on a concept by Peter Limberg and Lubomir Arsov. Full story here: https://highexistence.com/cancel-god/\n\n\"Darkness hovers above us. You can feel it, but you cannot see it. \n\nYou feel it in your office, your classroom, your social media feed. You even feel it in your body, which shudders with fear at the thought of speaking what you believe to be true. \n\nA God has been summoned. The Cancel God.\n\nThe Cancel God wants to cancel you. It wants to cancel everyone you know,. It wants to cancel humanity itself. \n\nSo be a good boy. Be a good girl. Say the right things at the right time and in the right way. Be very careful not to offend because you are now inherently offensive. \n\nDelete your old comments, your old threads, your old self. Get on your knees and start to apologise and apologise. And apologise and apologise.\" - Peter Limberg, 'The Cancel God'.\n\nCheck out Peter's Stoa project: https://www.thestoa.ca/\n\nCheck out Peter's daily meditations: https://thestoa.substack.com/\n\nCheck out Lubomir's \"In-Shadow\" animation: https://youtu.be/j800SVeiS5I",
