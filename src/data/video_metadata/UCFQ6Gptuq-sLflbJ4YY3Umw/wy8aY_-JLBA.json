 "description": "In these polarised, fractured times, what does a real conversation look like? One where people feel free to speak their minds, change their minds, and to create the possibility of something genuinely new emerging. How do we discuss ideas and disagree with one another in a way that leads somewhere new, rather than forcing us deeper into tribalism?\n\nAbout five months ago, we committed to seeing what it might actually look like. And so, after months of planning, 150 people from around the world gathered in London for the first Rebel Wisdom Summit on Sunday, 12th of May.\n\nFeaturing four of the most brilliant speakers we\u2019ve interviewed on the channel\u200a\u2014\u200aBret Weinstein, Heather Heying, Iain McGilchrist and Jordan Greenhall\u200a\u2014\u200athe Summit was unlike anything we\u2019ve tried before; an experiment in having an immersive, participatory and evolutionary conversation.\n\nTo see the full film of the event - become a Rebel Wisdom Subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nTo register for the next one - please email: summit@rebelwisdom.co.uk",
