 "description": "Earlier this summer, a film featuring women apologising for how they had treated men went viral online. The Rebel Wisdom film looking at the process of making the film, and the reactions it created: 'The female shadow?'' is here: https://youtu.be/N6TLvu3l0Ns\n\nThe film's creator, Dr Hanna Milling called for a new dialogue between men and women. In this experimental film, two women - Hanna and author Ilan Stefani ('What the brothel taught me about life') sit down with two men, Rebel Wisdom founders David Fuller and Rafia Morgan to attempt a new form of conversation.\n\nThis is part of a series, 'Men and Women After #Metoo', which includes an exclusive interview with Warren Farrell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESiyb28fTQ4&t=1955s\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform asking the biggest questions: http://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nWe also run events for men and women to experience directly what we discuss in our films: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/events\n\nTo discuss the ideas in our films, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW\n\nTo see more great films, and to help us make more, please consider becoming a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom",
