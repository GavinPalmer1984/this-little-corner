 "description": "Tim Lott was the first mainstream UK journalist to profile Jordan Peterson, in the Spectator magazine. A novelist and storyteller, he also describes himself as an 'old lefty'.\n\nIn this, he discusses with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller how the 'left' has changed in his lifetime - what the current left could learn from Jordan Peterson's thought, and the effect that a new ideological thinking is having on art and literature.\n\nTim's Spectator piece about Jordan Peterson: https://life.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/jordan-peterson-and-the-transgender-wars/\n\nTim's brilliant novel, 'The Scent of Dried Roses': https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scent-Dried-Roses-Suburbia-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI92KC/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1\n\nThis film is part of a larger Rebel Wisdom series, \"Jordan Peterson and the left, a new conversation\". The other films are as follows.\n\nMain discussion with new Jordan Peterson interview: https://youtu.be/6sUtOOOVcqw\n\n'What can the left learn from Jordan Peterson', with Matthew Segall and Jesse Estrin from the California Institute of Integral Studies: https://youtu.be/jwMxmg83aUw \n\n'Jordan Peterson and Integral Theory', with Jeff Salzman of the Daily Evolver: https://youtu.be/hfJbrS75_Gs\n\n'Jordan Peterson and the patriarchy', with Lene Andersen: https://youtu.be/dvyo1w5Ff_A\n\n'Beyond polarisation?' The left & Jordan Peterson, with Ronan Harrington, Alter Ego: https://youtu.be/t6Fwhs3HBGE\n\nIf you enjoy our films, please consider helping us make more by funding us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom",
