 "description": "Helen Pluckrose and Peter Boghossian have taken up positions at the front lines of the culture war. To highlight what they saw as ideological capture of the universities, they submitted hoax papers to high profile journals in the social sciences - what they called the 'grievance studies' hoax. Seven were published, including one on 'Rape Culture' in dog parks, and one with extracts from Hitler's Mein Kampf.\n\nFor more, check out Mike Nayna's film, 'Pushing Back on Grievance Studies': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLBMxAx4NAw\n\nIn this discussion, they talk about the importance of a 'responsible left' taking on postmodernism, being a target for online hate, and the need to stay open to dialogue and criticism.\n\nThis is a follow up to our previous film, 'Impossible Conversations': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08RoXYz9_UU\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can listen to a podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
