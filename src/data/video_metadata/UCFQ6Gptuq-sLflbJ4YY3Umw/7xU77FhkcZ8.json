The aim of the IDW is to have difficult, nuanced conversations in public.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller they explain how their experience at Evergreen has influenced their discussions of sex and gender.\n\nHeather and Bret will be appearing at the first 'Rebel Wisdom Summit' on May 12 in London. For more information, visit https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/summit\n\nWe've just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
