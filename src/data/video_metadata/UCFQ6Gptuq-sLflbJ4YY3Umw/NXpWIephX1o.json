 "description": "This film is part of Rebel Wisdom's ongoing Sensemaking Series.\n\nPart 1, What the F*ck is Going On? is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkKnOEQlwl4\n\nRebel Wisdom published the first documentary on Jordan Peterson in January 2018. Just days later he shot to fame on a viral interview on Channel 4 News, where Rebel Wisdom's founder David Fuller worked for a decade.\n\nThis sparked a new film, 'Glitch in the Matrix, Jordan Peterson, the Mainstream Media and the Intellectual Dark Web' that has been viewed over five million times. \n\nIn this talk from the end of 2019, David Fuller explains the origin story, and what happened next as he continued to follow the trail of the Intellectual Dark Web.\n\nLinks:\n\nGlitch in the Matrix I: https://youtu.be/trhTbEs2GGE\n\nGlitch in the Matrix II: https://youtu.be/TKeMIWVOnbo\n\nJay Shapiro on Rebel Wisdom: https://youtu.be/MX_vzjEl02o\n\nTimbah on Toast, Dave Rubin's Battle of Ideas: https://youtu.be/u3TPxQao3m0 (Pt 1), https://youtu.be/a3h9YyzqBxs (Pt 2), https://youtu.be/N2LOvoDCPS8 (Pt 3)\n\nCathy Young's Quillette piece on the IDW and tribalism: https://quillette.com/2019/05/24/how-the-idw-can-avoid-the-tribalist-pull/\n\nPeter Limberg and Conor Barnes' Medium piece on memetic tribes: https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb",
