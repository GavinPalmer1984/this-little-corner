We sat down to discuss the reaction, the cultural context behind it and our response to the ad. Drawing on our interviews with Warren Farrell, Cassie Jaye and our experience leading men's retreats, we ask whether the ad is helping men or toxic in and of itself.\n\nWe recently had an article in the Guardian about our men's retreats: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/15/the-search-for-my-inner-hero-a-modern-masculinity-retreat\n\nOur retreats:
