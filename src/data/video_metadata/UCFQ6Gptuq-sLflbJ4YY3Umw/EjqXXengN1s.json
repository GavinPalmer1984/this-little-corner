 "description": "Psychologist and professor Jordan Peterson has come to fame, or notoriety depending on your perspective, over the last year. But many of those who found him through his criticisms of political correctness are saying they have discovered one of the world's most significant thinkers - why? Rebel Wisdom investigates. \n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media organisation making films about the biggest subjects. For more: http://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nCORRECTION/CLARIFICATION: In the film - there is a line about Gnosticism that we now believe to be incorrect - apologies to Dr Peterson for that. There is an interesting discussion in the comments with Jonathan Pageau and others about this. \n\nFor the first part of the full interview with Jordan Peterson, 'Mysticism, Spirit and the Shadow': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAsR6DZTvS8\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this documentary, please consider supporting our work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\nFor the original interviews for some of the clips featured in this video, thanks to Transliminal & Joe Rogan.\n\nIdeology, Logos and Belief: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC1pvjyKYr4\nReligion, Myth, Science, Truth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis\nJoe Rogan podcast 958: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USg3NR76XpQ&t=1s\n\nPlease also consider supporting Transliminal on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/transliminal/posts",
