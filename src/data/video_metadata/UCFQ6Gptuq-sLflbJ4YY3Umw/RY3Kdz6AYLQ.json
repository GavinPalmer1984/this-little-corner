 "description": "If you want to put into practice some of the skills we talk about on Rebel Wisdom, develop your sovereignty and upgrade your sensemaking, join the latest edition of our online course, Sensemaking 101.\n\nBeginning on 4th February, it features live instruction from guest faculty Daniel Schmachtenberger, Diane Musho Hamilton, John Vervaeke & Doshin Roshi.\n\nSensemaking 101 is an individual and collective exploration of some of the most important ideas and practices we've explored on Rebel Wisdom.\n\nMore than 60 people filled out an anonymous feedback survey after our last cohort, rating the course 9/10 overall and 9/10 for value for money.\n\nThe first two cohorts sold out in a couple of weeks and we expect this one to as well. If you want to join, you can read more on: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses\n\nOr book on https://www.tickettailor.com/events/rebelwisdom/444524\n\nWe have also made concessions available for those who can't afford to attend - fill out this form to apply: http://bit.ly/39YUaJk",
