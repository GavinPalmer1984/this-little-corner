 "description": "The pandemic has led a lot of people to rethink every aspect of their lives, where they work, where they live, who they live with.\n\nRich Bartlett says it's created a huge boost in the number of people who say they want to create community. But it's not so easy.\n\nRich has spent the last decade or so looking at why communities succeed, why they fail, and how to create methods of connection and growth.\n\nTogether with his wife Nati, they run workshops in 'Microsolidarity'. \n\nStarting on Thursday 10th December, they will be running an exclusive four session course for Rebel Wisdom members - to join this, and many other sessions, check: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
