 "description": "Rebel Wisdom has been covering the ongoing controversy over the claims to do with the drug Ivermectin and those who claim the Covid vaccines are dangerous.\n\nThe principle advocate for Ivermectin has been the doctor Pierre Kory and his organisation the Frontline Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC).\n\nHowever, behind the scenes there has been growing concern about the closeness between the FLCCC and anti-vaccine activists.\n\nEric Osgood MD was part of the FLCCC, but is now speaking out publicly about what he observed, and raising the alarm.\n\nThis is released at the same time as our final installment in the investigation into the vaccine claims on the Dark Horse podcast: https://youtu.be/pyhWkiG7wAU\n\nThis is part of Rebel Wisdom's series of films on this topic. Find the others on our YouTube homepage.",
