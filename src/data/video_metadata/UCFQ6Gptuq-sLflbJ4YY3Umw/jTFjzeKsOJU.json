We recommend watching 'Sensemaking the Lab Leak' first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQikatEYbI\n\nBret has argued the case for a lab leak for many months, on his Dark Horse podcast, and on shows like Bill Maher. \n\nYuri Deigin is an entrepreneur and independent researcher with the 'DRASTIC' collective (Decentralised Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating Covid-19).\n\nYuri Deigin will be joining the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire for a discussion with Rebel Wisdom Members around this topic on Monday 21st July: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events\n\nWe have put together a comprehensive newsletter and briefing document on the Lab Leak story, see here: https://mailchi.mp/rebelwisdom.co.uk/8sgup081zu", "duration": 3371, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "[Music]", "start":
