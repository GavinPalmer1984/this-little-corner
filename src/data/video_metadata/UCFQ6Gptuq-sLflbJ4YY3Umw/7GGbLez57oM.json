 "description": "What is Rebel Wisdom? (We've made a channel trailer!)\n\nWhen our existing assumptions and ways of thinking break down, it's the rebels and the renegades, those who dare to think differently, who are needed to reboot the system.\n\nRebel Wisdom is founded on the conviction that we are seeing a civilisational-level crisis of ideas, as the old operating system breaks down. The new is struggling to emerge - and the most transformative ideas always show up first as rebellious.\n\nIn these times of change, we can no longer trust the traditional media to make sense of the world. The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. Facilitated by new technology, it\u2019s made a new kind of conversation possible; more in-depth, more open and more democratic.\n\nFuelled by social media, many have become trapped in reaction and ideology, yet big questions can only be explored with open-minded, self-reflective, grounded conversations.\n\nRebel Wisdom looks to move beyond ideology. We create our content with the intention of engaging with the whole person \u2013 intellect, body, and intuition - to create honest discussions.\n\nIn a time where truth has become whatever you want it to be - we believe in the rebellious, transformative power of genuine Truth. That's why we also run events in the real world, to help people live out the ideas in our films for themselves. \n\nConversations that strive for Truth can have a profound effect on our lives. Right now, they are also the most rebellious.\n\nThis film contains clips from:\n\nFull Jordan Peterson Interview: \"Sam Harris, the Intellectual Dark Web & the crisis of the left\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=husJZ2THQdU&t=125s\n\nUnderstanding the Intellectual Dark Web, with Matthew Segall and Jesse Estrin (Patreon special)\n\n'Apocalypse Now?' with Jordan Greenhall and Akira the Don: https://youtu.be/EL_S0p9UVcM\n\n'Humanity's Phase Shift', Daniel Schmachtenberger (Patreon exclusive)\n\nEvolution & the future - Bret Weinstein & Jamie Wheal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KigJ5rn-4yE&t=25s\n\n'How to steal fire from the Gods' with Jamie Wheal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1eXSvl5rn8&t=1738s\n\nTo watch these Patreon exclusive films, and to support us to make more and to become part of the conversation, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom",
