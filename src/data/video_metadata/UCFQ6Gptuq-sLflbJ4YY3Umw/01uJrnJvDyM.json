But not anti-racism as practiced by the likes of Ibram Kendi or Robin DiAngelo (White Fragility).\n\nIn fact, she believes that Critical Race Theory is a betrayal of the artistic heritage of Black America.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, they cover the legacy of black art, the inheritance of Martin Luther King and much more.\n\nChloe's work can be found here:
