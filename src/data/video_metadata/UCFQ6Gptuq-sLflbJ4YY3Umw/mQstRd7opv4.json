 "description": "How do we play the Infinite Game? And how will that help us make sense of a world in chaos?\n\nIn the hit film 'War on Sensemaking', Daniel Schmachtenberger laid out how the information ecology was profoundly broken, and how impossible it was to act if we didn't know what was true. \n\nIn this response, flow expert Jamie Wheal outlines his answer to Daniel's question, outlining what the 'Infinite Game' looks like, how we might uplevel human consciousness and what a 'Game B' society might look like. \n\nRebel Wisdom are now running regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for our members, including Jamie on Wednesday January 29th, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
