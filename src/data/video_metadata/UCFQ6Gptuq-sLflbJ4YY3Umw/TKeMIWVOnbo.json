 "description": "The phrase 'Intellectual Dark Web' was first coined by mathematician Eric Weinstein in early 2018, it quickly spread. Was this just a chance remark, or was there a plan?\n\nThis film explains how the creation of the Intellectual Dark Web was part of a long term strategy, and sketches out Eric's account of the history, and the future of the project. \n\nThis is a Rebel Wisdom Documentary, to help us make more, to see exclusive subscriber-only films and join the conversation, please consider becoming a supporter on www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe are also announcing the Rebel Wisdom Summit - our largest event yet, in London on May 12, with Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, Iain McGilchrist and Jordan Greenhall, more details here: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/summit\n\nSome of these topics were sketched out in greater detail by Eric Weinstein on Edge.org.\n\nKayfabe: https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783\n\nWar on Excellence: https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23879\n\nRussell Conjugation: https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181",
