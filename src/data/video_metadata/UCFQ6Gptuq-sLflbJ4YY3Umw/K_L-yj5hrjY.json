 "description": "The great psychologist and psychedelic therapist Stanislav Grof described psychedelics as a \"non-specific amplifier\" of consciousness, meaning that they made everything more intense, both positive and negative experiences.\n\nIf the pandemic crisis has acted like a non specific amplifier of many of the existing issues with society and culture, and we are now all in an altered state together, how can we best navigate it?\n\nErik Davis is a historian of psychedelic culture, and in this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller he looks at what can be learnt from the pioneers of the past, such as Terence McKenna, Philip K. Dick and Robert Anton Wilson.\n\nHe is the creator of the site Technosis, and the author of many books including \"High Weirdness\": https://techgnosis.com/\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
