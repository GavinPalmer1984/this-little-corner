 "description": "Our interview with Zen master Doshin Roshi, 'A Zen master talks about Jordan Peterson and the Shadow', was a viral hit, one of our most viewed films of the last year.  Original film here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABWeA203Q-c&t=311s\n\nIt also created hugely polarised reactions - with people either loving, or hating Doshin's style.\n\nWe go back to talk to him about the reaction to the film, why people either loved or hated it - and why some found him a creepy cult leader.\n\nFor access to exclusive member-only content, including a new film with Doshin explaining how to go about integrating the shadow, and to join the conversation - become part of the Rebel Wisdom community - go to: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe also run weekend retreats for men: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/retreats\n\nYou can also support us via bitcoin here: 3DGbLDVxcYe9QQqhUKhYEKs3oTGBVZsEZt\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/",
