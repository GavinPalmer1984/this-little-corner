 "description": "John Vervaeke's 'Awakening From the Meaning Crisis' has been an influential hit of 2019. A professor at Toronto University's psychology department, the series sketches out a big vision of the trajectory of western thought from the axial age to the present day.\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, he talks about the impact that the series has had on his life, and the journey he has been on since the start of 2019, and what comes next - his new series, 'After Socrates'.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
