 "description": "This is one of the most influential works of philosophical exploration of all time. Jonathan Rowson returns to the Digital Campfire for our Book Club session to explain why he has chosen this book as one the most impactful he has read. \n\nOriginally published in 1974, Robert M. Pirsig's classic is part road trip, part deep philosophical investigation into the roots of both Western and Eastern thought, framed around the central enigmatic question, what is \"Quality\".\n\nTo join events like this, consider becoming a Rebel Wisdom member: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nJonathan Rowson is a philosopher, chess grandmaster and founding Director of Perspectiva, a collective of scholars, artists, futurists and seekers in London that work on the relationship between systems, souls and society in theory and practice. \nPerspectiva's YouTube channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr0bTKEq3EwYsN3MoHIzdwQ\nYou can find Jonathan's website: https://www.jonathanrowson.me and follow him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Rowson\n\nJonathan is an Open Society Fellow, and a Fellow at the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey. He was previously Director of the Social Brain Centre at the Royal Society of Arts where he authored a range of influential research reports on behaviour change, climate change and spirituality, and curated and chaired a range of related events. Jonathan is an applied philosopher with degrees from Oxford, Harvard and Bristol Universities. In a former life he was a chess Grandmaster and British Champion (2004\u20136) and views the game as a continuing source of insight and inspiration. He has published work in The Guardian, New Statesman and New York Times. His book, The Moves that Matter \u2013 A Grandmaster on the Game of Life was published by Bloomsbury in 2019. He hails from Aberdeen in Scotland but lives in Putney, London.",
