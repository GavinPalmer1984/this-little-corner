 "description": "There is much talk in the media about 'toxic masculinity', but almost none about 'toxic femininity'.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Heather Heying first coined the term in an article for the online magazine Quillette: https://quillette.com/2017/07/09/on-toxic-femininity/\n\nShe talks about her understanding of the concept with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller.\n\nCheck out Heather's other film with Rebel Wisdom, 'From Evergreen to the Intellectual Dark Web': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbw3DoUOgtY&t=332s\n\nFor access to exclusive member-only content, and to join the conversation - become part of the Rebel Wisdom community - go to: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can also support us via bitcoin here: 3DGbLDVxcYe9QQqhUKhYEKs3oTGBVZsEZt\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/",
