 "description": "This is a short video to announce an upcoming film project with John Vervaeke, and an opportunity to contribute ideas and skills to help make it happen. \n\nThe aim of the film is primarily to answer the question 'Where do you start?' when encountering John's work, what do you send to someone as an introduction?\n\nWe are particularly interested to hear from skilled animators, documentary producers or other TV folk. Other contributions on how to tell the story also welcome - email: projects@rebelwisdom.co.uk",
