 "description": "Brian Rose is running for London Mayor, trailing controversy and scandal. Check out the recent Rebel Wisdom piece with Coffeezilla for background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nxnyOO1hoA&t=317s\n\nRose became well known through the YouTube channel London Real, which began as a two-person show, with co-host Nic Gabriel (Nic Gregoriades). \n\nOne day in 2013 however, Nick simply vanished from the show, with no explanation given. Since then he has watched from the sidelines and kept his silence. However, he now feels the time has come to speak out. \n\nCheck out the podcast conversation between Nic and David Fuller on Liberation Mentor last year: https://www.liberationmentor.com/rebel-wisdom-david-fuller/\n\nCheck out Rebel Wisdom's other films on Brian Rose and London Real: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/films/34-film-content/london-real-series",
