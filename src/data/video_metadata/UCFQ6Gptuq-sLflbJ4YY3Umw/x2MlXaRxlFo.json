This is despite us featuring both sides of the argument, with Ivermectin advocate Tess Lawrie matched with two skeptics, Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz and Graham Walker MD.\n\nAfter appealing the decision the film was reinstated, with no explanation so far. Which shows the problem with the unaccountability of the big tech platforms, and emphasises many of the problems we've been taking about in the alternative media space.\n\nAlso check out our full
