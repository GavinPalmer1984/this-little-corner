In 'Passion of the Western Mind', he presented a vast overview of the history of western thought and culture, with predictions of where both were heading. On its release it was hailed as a masterpiece, allowing \"readers to grasp the big picture of Western culture as if for the first time\".\n\nTwenty-five years on from its release, the world has changed dramatically, how has his thought changed?\n\nAnd in a time of renewed interest in philosophy and big ideas, what does Richard Tarnas make of the rise of Jordan Peterson and the Intellectual Dark Web?\n\nThe epilogue to Passion of the Western Mind is online here: http://www.gaiamind.com/Tarnas.html\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around.
