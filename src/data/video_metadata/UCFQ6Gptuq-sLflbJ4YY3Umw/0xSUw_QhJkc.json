He describes it as a \"yoga of deep transformational conversations\".\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, they explore the emergent conversation that Rebel Wisdom has been tracking, and how this practice of Circling applies to it.\n\nCheck out Guy's website: https://www.circlinginstitute.com/\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content and to join this evolving
