 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAtE0tahtM",
 "date": "2019-05-16",
 "description": "Increasingly restrictive speech codes are being brought into workplaces, universities and other places.\n\nGeoffrey Miller is an evolutionary psychologist, he makes the case that in the name of avoiding discrimination, the new rules may well be causing it.\n\nThey often rely on banning language that can 'reasonably' be assumed to be offensive. But how is this decided? And is that rule actually discriminatory towards people who have social difficulties, such as asbergers or other 'neurodiverse' individuals.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store!
