He has joined the emergent intellectual awakening, looking for ways to bring together science, psychology and the world's wisdom traditions.\n\nA colleague of Jordan Peterson's in the University of Toronto Psychology Department, he specialises in Cognitive Science, Buddhism and also teaches Tai Chi and Mindfulness.\n\nHe sat down to talk about his series, and where he thinks this emergent conversation is heading.\n\nGo and subscribe to John's channel! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqDUjTsof-kTNpnyWper_Q\n\nFor the second part of this interview with John, and to get access to more
