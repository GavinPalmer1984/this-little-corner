Why is the 'information ecology' so damaged, and what would it take to make it healthy? \n\nThis is a fundamental question, because without good sensemaking, we cannot even begin to act in the world. It is also a central concern in what many are calling the \"meaning crisis\", because what is meaningful is connected to what is real.\n\nDaniel is a founding member of The Consilience Project, aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue. The throughline of his interests has to do with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and society, with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal. Towards these ends, he\u2019s had particular interest in the topics of catastrophic and existential risk, civilization and institutional decay and collapse as well as progress, collective action problems, social organization theories, and the relevant domains in philosophy and science. \n\nTo get access to more exclusive content and to join this evolving conversation, become a Rebel Wisdom
