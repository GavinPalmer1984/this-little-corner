This is the second in a series of three films on 'Men and Women after #metoo' from Rebel Wisdom.\n\nThe Red Pill Movie was a sleeper documentary hit about the Men's Rights Movement in the USA. Despite some very negative reviews from mainstream publications, it became one of the most popular documentaries of the last few years.\n\nIt was subtitled, 'A feminist goes inside the Men's Rights Movement', and the director Cassie Jaye describes herself as a liberal. What does the reaction to it say about the cultural conversation, and how authentic was the film? Rebel Wisdom talks to Cassie Jaye. \n\nPart 1 of 'Men and Women after #metoo' is our podcast where we discuss the issues raised by these films in depth: https://youtu.be/1MdjtBp_BS8\n\nPart 3 is an exclusive interview with the former feminist leader and 'father of the Men's Rights movement', Warren Farrell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESiyb28fTQ4&t=1930s\n\nYou can view the Red Pill Movie trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzeakKC6fE\nOr rent the film here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mB13NV7rY0\n\nThis film is part of a Rebel Wisdom series - 'Men and Women after #metoo, a new conversation', including exclusive interviews with the 'father of the men's movement' Warren Farrell and Hanna Milling, the author of the viral hit film 'From Women to Men'.\n\nCheck out our podcast where we discuss the issues raised by these films in depth: https://youtu.be/1MdjtBp_BS8\n\nWarren Farrell interview here: https://youtu.be/ESiyb28fTQ4\n\nRebel Wisdom is running workshops
