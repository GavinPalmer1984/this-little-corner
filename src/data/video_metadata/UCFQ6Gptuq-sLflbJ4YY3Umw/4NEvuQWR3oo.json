 "date": "2018-02-09",
 "description": "Jordan Greenhall wrote one of the most compelling and widely shared analyses of the political landscape in the wake of the Trump election - 'Deep Code' - about how the consensus mainstream media reality \"Blue Church\" was being disrupted by a new insurgent \"Red Religion\". He believes the recent viral interview between Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News was another example of the consensus reality breaking down - a \"glitch in the matrix\". He talks to Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller - who made the first documentary about Jordan Peterson AND used to work at Channel 4 News for many years.\n\nRebel Wisdom: Jordan Peterson, Truth in the Time of Chaos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjqXXengN1s&t=900s\n\nDeep Code: Situational Assessment 2017, Trump Edition\nhttps://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046\n\nIf you enjoyed this - please do consider helping us make more great content by sponsoring us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\n\nMore content: http://rebelwisdom.co.uk/",
