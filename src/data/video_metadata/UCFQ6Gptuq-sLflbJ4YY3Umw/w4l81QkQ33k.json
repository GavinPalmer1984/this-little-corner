 "description": "This film was initially uploaded on Weds 25th, but then taken down by YouTube on Sunday 29th, for \"medical misinformation\". The appeal was rejected, with no further opportunity for appeal and a Community Guidelines strike added to the channel. However, the situation got a lot of traction on Twitter, and the journalist Matt Taibbi made sustained inquiries with YouTube, and the film was restored, with no explanation offered at any point along the journey. We will continue to pursue this story and try to find out why and what happened.\n\nThis version of the film also has been fixed, after the first version froze for the last half hour.\n\nOriginal film text and links here:\n\nThis is the final edition of Rebel Wisdom's series of films looking at the claims that have been made around the drug Ivermectin and vaccine safety on Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying's Dark Horse podcast (timecodes for content listed below).\n\nIt is released at the same time as an important interview with Eric Osgood MD telling the real backstory of what has been happening with Pierre Kory's FrontLine Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance:  https://youtu.be/XClxXWWuyG4\n\n(This video freezes around half an hour before the end - apologies - was an error with the original video file).\n\nThe previous film in this series was our investigation into the claims on the Dark Horse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plLmTWHeKrI&t=13s\n\nYuri Deigin's response to Bret Weinstein is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwzfnZfo-rU\n\nArticles and videos mentioned here: \n\nAtlantic article on Robert Malone: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/\n\nDebate between Steve Kirsch and Avi Bitterman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nF2YAn9DQ\n\nMost of this film was recorded in a live event in Rebel Wisdom's Digital Campfire, to join conversations like this, check out the membership options here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nTimecodes for content: \n\n02:50 - Structure of call, address criticisms\n04:30 - Tried to avoid oppositional back and forth\n07:34 - What are our obligations in the alternative media space?\n08:22 - Accusations of Bad Faith\n13:23 - Beware of powerful narratives on both sides\n16:12 - Why don't we change our minds?\n21:35 - Heather Heying - \"no careful scientific pushback\"\n26:10 - Assessing the science on Ivermectin\n29:44 - \"Skipped animal trials\"\n31:20 - The Case of Leslie Lawrenson\n32:00 - Vaccines created variants?\n36:18 - Bret Weinstein - \"I'm deeply frustrated with David\"\n40:58 - Why I interviewed Yuri Deigin\n47:00 - The narrative around Ivermectin falls apart\n51:49 - If you don't call out the bullshit on your own side, you cannot be trusted\n52:10 - Is Robert Malone a \"whistleblower\"?\n54:26 - Andrew Wakefield and the history of the anti-vaccine movement\n57:24 - Avoiding any kind of dialogue with people who disagree\n01:00:12 - Rebel Wisdom? More like conventional wisdom!\n01:02:11 Question - Does the responsibility for balance lie with individual podcasters or the entire ecosystem?",
