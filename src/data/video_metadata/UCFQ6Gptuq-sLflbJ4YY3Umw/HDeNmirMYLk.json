 "description": "Integral philosophy has been a big influence on many of Rebel Wisdom's guests over the years. So we brought together three key figures, meditator and mediator Diane Musho Hamilton, the host of the popular Daily Evolver podcast Jeff Salzman and the author of the book Developmental Politics, Steve McIntosh.\n\nThey talked about how the integral map can help make sense of the responses to the pandemic, we discussed Jordan Peterson and the Intellectual Dark Web, and also responded to recent critiques of developmental thinking from the likes of Nora Bateson.\n\nThis was a dialogue and Q&A with Rebel Wisdom members in our Digital Campfire.",
