 "description": "The animated film 'In Shadow - A Modern Odyssey' has been a viral hit online, with millions of views on different platforms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j800SVeiS5I&t=236s\n\nIt is an unsparing and dystopian vision of today's society, but with a hopeful and transformative conclusion.\n\nIt was the work of one man, Toronto-based artist Lubomir Arsov. In this discussion with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, he talks about the origin and meaning of the film, and why few artists seem willing and able to tackle such important and vital topics.\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
