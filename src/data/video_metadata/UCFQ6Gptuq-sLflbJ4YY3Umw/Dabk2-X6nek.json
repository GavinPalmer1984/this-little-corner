Rebel Wisdom was quick to recognise the significance of this new movement, featuring it in our 'Glitch in the Matrix' film in February. In the latest edition of the Rebel Wisdom podcast, David Fuller and Alexander Beiner take a closer look at the IDW, and explain what it means, and where it might be heading - as a potential 'great awakening' and intellectual synthesis.\n\nThis podcast accompanies a new article from Andrew Sweeny, the Intellectual Deep Web:
