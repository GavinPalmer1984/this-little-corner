around the vaccines and the drug Ivermectin. \n\nYesterday Quillette published an article highly critical of Bret co-authored by Yuri Deigin, one of the researchers who uncovered evidence on the 'lab leak' hypothesis and a former guest on Bret's podcast: https://quillette.com/2021/07/06/looking-for-covid-19-miracle-drugs-we-already-have-them-theyre-called-vaccines/\n\nThis was a discussion about the deeper issues at play, the difficulties of finding truth and why the different narratives around these issues don't seem to come into contact with each other. \n\nIt was a dialogue held in the Rebel Wisdom Digital Campfire including Max Borders, the executive director of Social Evolution, a non-profit startup dedicated to liberating people and solving social problems through innovation, and Joshua Zader, an online entrepreneur with a background in clinical psychology and a passion for circling.\n\nTo join conversations like this, check out Rebel Wisdom's membership options:
