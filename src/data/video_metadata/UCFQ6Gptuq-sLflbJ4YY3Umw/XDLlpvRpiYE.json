Taking place in London on May 30 and 31, it's a two day indoor festival of rebellious ideas and profound experiences. Join some of the world's most pioneering minds as we find new ways to make sense together, experiment and build the future.\n\nIn this film we introduce our speakers with some clips, including Daniel Schmachtenberger, Rupert Sheldrake, Nora Bateson, John Vervaeke, Rosalind Watts, Jules Evans, Greg Thomas and more. We also talk about what\u2019s going to happen at the Festival, including our \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 format, and the workshops on offer to help us develop our sovereignty, sensemaking and tap into different ways of knowing - including meditation, breathwork, Circling, dialogos and more.\n\nRead more on https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/festival and book your ticket on
