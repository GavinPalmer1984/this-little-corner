 "description": "Over the last month, Rebel Wisdom has been interviewing some of the brightest minds in systems change and complexity to make sense of the crisis and possible responses to it.  \n\nOne thing that has emerged in these conversations is the importance of understanding myth and stories to contextualise what we're experiencing. Rebel Wisdom's Alexander Beiner interviewed three people with an understanding of how myths, stories and wisdom traditions give us a new insight into the crisis: Zak Stein, Stephen Jenkinson and Charlotte du Cann. Here, we weave these conversations together with ideas we've explored on the channel in the past to look at the mythopoetic landscape of the pandemic.\n\nThis film is accompanied by an article on our Medium page that explores the ideas in the film in more detail:\nhttps://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/traversing-the-underworld-what-myth-can-teach-us-during-the-pandemic-802d07683d44\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com\n\nYou can also become a Rebel Wisdom member, for many benefits including our regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
