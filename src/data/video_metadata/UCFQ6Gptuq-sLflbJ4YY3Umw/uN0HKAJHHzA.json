In it he drew a clear and compelling story of how the history of the western world was best viewed as a gradual takeover by the rational, logical left side of the brain, eclipsing the more holistic right brain. \n\nEarlier this year, he had a fascinating and widely praised discussion with Jordan Peterson. In this film he reflects on that experience - and where his philosophy aligns with, and departs from, Peterson's.\n\nThis is the second part of a 2 part interview - first part 'Certainty and Flow' is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI1ngqwH5us&t=572s\n\nA film about his work will be released next year, 'The Divided Brain' - trailer here: https://vimeo.com/304915837", "duration": 1655,
