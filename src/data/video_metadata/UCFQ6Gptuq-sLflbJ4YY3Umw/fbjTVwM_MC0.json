In a three way conversation, we try to make sense of cultural phenomena like Wokeism and Conspirituality to figure out whether they're historical blips, new forms of religious worship, or something else entirely. \n\nJules Evans is the bestselling author of 'Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations' and has recently popularised the term 'Conspirituality' to explain the strange union of new age and far right ideas in 2020. Find him on https://www.philosophyforlife.org/\n\nJonathan Pageau is the host of 'The Symbolic World', a popular YouTube channel in which he explores symbolism in religion, art as well as in general and popular culture. You can find him on https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageau\n\nRebel Wisdom's Sensemaking course launches again in February, check it out here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/courses", "duration": 2894,
