This took the form of a long essay, trying to wrestle with what he called 'Petersonitis': https://integral-review.org/an-epistemic-thunderstorm-what-we-learned-and-failed-to-learn-from-jordan-petersons-rise-to-fame/\n\nNow, more than three years on, he talks through the experience with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, the creator of multiple films about the Peterson phenomenon.\n\nFull interview with Peterson at the RSA is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD-VCRNIp-U\n\nRebel Wisdom is hosting a Q&A on this film with Jonathan in our Digital Campfire on Thursday 10th June, to join, become a member: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nCheck out Jonathan's project Perspectiva:
