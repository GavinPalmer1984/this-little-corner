 "description": "What have we learnt from Brian Rose's spectacular London Mayor flameout, and assorted other scams? This was a conversation including Nic Gabriel, the original co-host of London Real, Coffeezilla, who has done so much to expose Brian over the last months, hosted by Rebel Wisdom in the Digital Campfire.\n\nDavid Fuller has just written a new Medium piece summarising the unanswered questions about Brian's mayoral bid, in particular, whether any of the money from the 'Digital Freedom Platform' scam was used to fund it. Brian is threatening to sue anyone who makes that claim, by the way: https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/did-brian-rose-use-the-money-he-scammed-from-his-followers-to-run-for-mayor-bb317cf68ddb\n\nCheck out the interview where Nic Gabriel broke his silence on Brian Rose & London Real: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hOQCUj3wyY&t=2267s\n\nNic's 'Liberation Mentor' podcast: https://www.liberationmentor.com/\n\nCoffeezilla's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQMnBA3CS502aghlcr0_aw\n\nAnd check out the upcoming conversations in the Digital Campfire here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/campfire-events",
