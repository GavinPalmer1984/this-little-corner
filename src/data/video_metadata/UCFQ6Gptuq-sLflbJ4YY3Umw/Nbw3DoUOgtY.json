targeted by a student mob and became the most high profile victims of campus militancy.\n\nThey are now both members of the new constellation of internet personalities known as the Intellectual Dark Web (IDW).\n\nIn this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, Heather discusses her journey so far, why sex and gender are the hottest topics for the modern left and why there are so few other women in the IDW.\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around. \nhttp://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nHelp us make more of these films and get access to excellent exclusive films for
