In this conversation with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, they discuss the emergent conversation bubbling up from the new online \"intellectual awakening\".\n\nThey talk about the differences between Jordan Peterson and Ken Wilber, how Integral philosophy can illustrate the current moment, and the new kids on the block, such as Daniel Schmachtenberger and Jamie Wheal.\n\nTerry's Bio: Terry Patten  is a philosopher, author, activist, social entrepreneur, consultant, coach, and the author of the groundbreaking book, A New Republic of the Heart: An Ethos for Revolutionaries.\n\nAs an author, he co-wrote the book Integral Life Practice (with Ken Wilber, Adam Leonard and Marco Morelli) which distills ancient and modern practices into a contemporary transformational lifestyle. He has also authored three previous books and over two dozen book chapters, magazine articles and academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content and to
