 "description": "This is one of a series of films from Rebel Wisdom on the science and psychology of polarisation. We recommend to start with the introduction film here: https://youtu.be/EUNHj5eh7BM\n\nDr Stephen Porges is a scientist, and creator of the hugely influential 'polyvagal theory'. Together with Peter Levine, he revolutionised the understanding of human connection, trauma and personal growth. \n\nHis work is also fundamentally important to understand how conversations break down, how we get psychological safety, and the roots of polarisation and division. \n\nTo get access to more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store! Buy T Shirts and more on https://shop.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nYou can listen to a podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n(this one will be available in podcast format only on Future Thinkers for now)\n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
