In this discussion with David Fuller and Alexander Beiner of Rebel Wisdom, they explore how Jordan Peterson's thought relates to integral - what are his insights and blind spots.\n\nRebel Wisdom Discord Chat: https://discord.gg/rJtyfFV\ufeff\n\nThis film is part of a larger Rebel Wisdom series, \"Jordan Peterson and the left, a new conversation\".
