Or do both narratives have some truth at the same time? \n\nThis is a discussion between Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller, Daniel Thorson from the Emerge podcast and Joshua Fields, the CEO of 'Consciousness Hacking' a San Francisco-based organisation aiming to harness techonology for personal and cultural transformation. \n\nJoshua and Daniel have delved deeply into the 'collapse' narrative in their work, and this conversation ranges from climate to Greta Thunberg, Extinction Rebellion and many other topics.\n\nRecent Rebel Wisdom interview with Joshua Fields:
