 "description": "The artist Jess de Wahls was cancelled for alleged 'transphobia', and then surprisingly un-cancelled by the Royal Academy in the UK. Is this the first time we've seen a major public body stand up against trans activists, and does it signal a major shift in the dynamics around activism and free speech?\n\nKathleen Stock is professor of Philosophy at the University of Sussex and a veteran of the long and often vicious battles over this topic, and has been attacked and deplatformed many times herself.\n\nShe discusses the history of the debate with Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller.\n\nJess de Wahl's original blog post that led to her 'cancelling': https://www.jessdewahls.com/blog/2019/8/5/somewhere-over-the-rainbow-something-went-terribly-wrong\n\nPicture of Kathleen Stock taken by Sonali Fernando",
