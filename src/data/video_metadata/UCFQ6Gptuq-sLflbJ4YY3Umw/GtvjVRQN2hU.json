He is embarking on a series of high profile public events with leading atheists like Sam Harris. Rupert Sheldrake is a rare combination - a scientist and a spiritual renegade, and has been debating atheists for decades. What does he make of Peterson, and what tactics does he think Peterson should use in his upcoming debates?\n\nRupert Sheldrake first came to public prominence with his book 'A New Science of Life'.\nhttps://www.sheldrake.org/books-by-rupert-sheldrake/a-new-science-of-life-morphic-resonance\n\nHis most high profile recent work was a deconstruction of the philosophy of scientific materialism, called the Science Delusion in the UK, and Science Set Free in the US.\nhttps://www.sheldrake.org/books-by-rupert-sheldrake/the-science-delusion-science-set-free\n\nAnd his most recent book is Science and Spiritual Practice.\nhttps://www.sheldrake.org/books-by-rupert-sheldrake/science-and-spiritual-practices\n\nThis was a Rebel Wisdom production, see our website for more and please
