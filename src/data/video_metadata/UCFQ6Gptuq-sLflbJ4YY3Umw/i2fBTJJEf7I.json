Slate Star Codex, a central node of the influential rationalist community.\n\nCalled 'Silicon Valley's Safe Space', it was widely criticised as an inaccurate hit piece: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html\n\nThis is an interview with Tom Chivers, the writer of 'The Rationalist's Guide to the Galaxy', on the backstory to the controversy.\n\nWhat does this say about the ongoing crisis of journalism, and tensions with the tech sector.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote a more well-received piece on SSC here: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/slate-star-codex-and-silicon-valleys-war-against-the-media\n\nTo join Rebel Wisdom's Digital Campfire, check out: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
