Thomas Chatterton Williams", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QquaILWgrZY", "date": "2020-06-29", "description": "As tensions rise over racial divisions throughout the western world, books like 'White Fragility' and 'How to Be An Anti-Racist' have flown to the top of the bestseller lists. These frame race as central to our understanding of the world.\n\nIn his book, 'Unlearning Race, Self-Portrait in Black and White', Thomas Chatterton Williams takes a very different tack, attempting
