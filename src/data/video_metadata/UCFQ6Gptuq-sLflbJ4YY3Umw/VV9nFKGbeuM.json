He joined our 'Wisdom Gym', where we hear from and work with some of the most cutting edge facilitators in the world.\n\nMindfulness has gone mainstream in the last decade, but we rarely talk about its shadow side and how it can lead to dysregulation and disassociation. \n\nIn this session, David took us through some easy and effective mindfulness techniques that take this into account, and explored how this ancient technique can be mainstreamed effectively.\n\nDavid is a writer, educator, and trauma professional who is pioneering a new form of trauma-aware mindfulness:
