 "title": "Culture vs Ecstasy, Jules Evans",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhSpxhhBV8",
 "date": "2019-01-21",
 "description": "Throughout history, rationalist western culture has had an ambivalent relationship with ecstatic experience and the transcendent. Philosopher Jules Evans has always been fascinated by ecstatic states and our response to them - from the ancient Greeks to the modern day.\n\nWe've never had more techniques for ecstasy, as technologies like psychedelics and meditation become ever more mainstream. But, Jules explains, they can be dangerous as well as liberating.\n\nThis is part of Rebel Wisdom's 'psychedelia' series - more to come.\n\nCheck out Jules's blog and sign up for his excellent newsletter here: http://www.philosophyforlife.org/\n\nWe're leaving Patreon, so to help us make more films and get access to exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom member here: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
