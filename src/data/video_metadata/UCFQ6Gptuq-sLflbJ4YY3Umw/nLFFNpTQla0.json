framework for understanding the nature of the deep shifts taking place below the surface of culture. \n\nIn it, he framed the growing conflict as something closer to revolutionary war than politics as usual, with four distinct fronts. \n\nNow, over two years after that celebrated analysis, how are those predictions holding up, and what is the state of play? \n\nOriginal 2017 posting here:
