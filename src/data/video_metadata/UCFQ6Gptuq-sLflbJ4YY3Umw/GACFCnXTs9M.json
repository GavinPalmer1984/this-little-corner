Check out https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/oneday for more details.\n\nThe day is designed to help you connect with others interested in these ideas, increase your resilience and sharpen your sensemaking in response to the pandemic. We'll make sense of the unfolding crisis with the help of Jamie Wheal, Diane Musho Hamilton, David Fuller & Alexander Beiner. We'll learn how to create anti-fragile communities and networks from Sara Ness and Rich Bartlett, and learn tips for personal resilience practices from a whole team of world-class facilitators. We're offering a lot of different types of practice, from breathwork and meditation to martial arts, yoga and authentic relating. \n\nThe event is free, all you have to do is sign up on the website: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/oneday\n\nWe've released a couple of resources we originally developed for our online course:\n\nA Guide to Inquiry: https://youtu.be/cxIt_OubC-E\n\nSovereignty Meditation: https://youtu.be/BFA5Rrj4W4M\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe are increasing our member calls and now running regular Q&As with the interviewees from our films for members, check out: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans",
