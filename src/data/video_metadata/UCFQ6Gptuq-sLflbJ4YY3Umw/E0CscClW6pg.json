 "description": "This is a reissue of a film we released a couple of years ago, originally called the Science and Psychology of Polarisation, which we are re-releasing now as it is even more relevant now than it was then.\n\nIt is part of our new \"State of Sensemaking\" series of films, check out the other films released over the next couple of weeks. We will be holding a big free event at the end of September also called the State of Sensemaking, with a few special guests, to register for it, go here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/state-of-sensemaking\n\nOriginal text for the Science and Psychology of Polarisation film was: \"How can we even begin to solve many of society's problems if our conversations keep breaking down? Polarisation has been growing for decades, and supercharged by social media filter bubbles.\n\nThis is the first in a series of films from Rebel Wisdom looking at the science and psychology of polarisation.\n\nWe speak to Alex Evans, a former government adviser now looking at the roots of division through the Collective Psychology Project: https://www.collectivepsychology.org/\n\nAlso to superstar trauma specialists Dr Stephen Porges, Peter Levine, Gina Ross and Steve Haines about how our nervous system is intimately involved in assessing safety and threat, and how that underlies all conflict and polarisation.\"",
