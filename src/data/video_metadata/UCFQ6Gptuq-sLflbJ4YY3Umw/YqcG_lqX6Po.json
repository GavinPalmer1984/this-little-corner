 "description": "In April, Rebel Wisdom ran a series of investigations into London Real's suspicious 'Digital Freedom Platform' fundraiser.\n\nNow the head of London Real, Brian Rose, has announced that he's running for Mayor of London. Meanwhile he's been deleting a load of his old videos and much more.\n\nWhat does the story of Brian Rose say about our society? What does it have in common with cult dynamics? And what is the 'sociopathic niche'?\n\nOriginal Investigation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDM1wTGOjOw&t=931s\n\nThis film has clips from:\n\nThe Paradox of the Times, Jordan Hall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SmGMJzWHK4\n\nHow to spot a cult, Jamie Wheal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9_FcnECNS8&t=812s\n\nConverting Moloch from Sith to Jedi w/ Daniel Schmachtenberger (The Stoa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk\n\nBrian Rose is Running for Mayor - I PREDICTED THIS!? (Coffeezilla): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9iwY_A84f4&t=97s\n\nThe King of Free Speech CENSORED Me!
