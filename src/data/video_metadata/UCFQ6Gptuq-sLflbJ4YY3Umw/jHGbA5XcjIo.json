 "description": "The Culture War that started in the 1960s has morphed into a new phase, where the left/right axis has fragmented into multiple tribes, fighting among each other.\n\nIn this film, Rebel Wisdom's Toronto Correspondent Peter Limberg lays out this new landscape, and describes the essential new tools we need to navigate it - 'memetic mediation', 'grey pills' and 'anti-debates'.\n\nThis film is based on the white paper 'The Memetic Tribes Of Culture War 2.0' written with Conor Barnes: https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb\n\nPeter will be at the Rebel Wisdom Festival in May 2020 - see here: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/festival\n\nThis was filmed at Bampot tea house in Toronto: https://bampottea.com/\n\nYou can listen to podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
