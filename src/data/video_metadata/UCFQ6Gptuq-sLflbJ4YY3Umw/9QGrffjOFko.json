It was a hugely popular film, with over 125,000 views in a month.\n\nIn this sequel he talks about how information is weaponised by all sides, and how to survive in an environment where nothing can be trusted. \n\nWar on Sensemaking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqaotiGWjQ\n\nDaniel will be at the Rebel Wisdom Festival in May 2020 - see here: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/festival\n\nYou can
