 "description": "If the cultural conversation looks increasingly like a dysfunctional relationship between men and women, how can we move forward? This is the third in a series of films on 'Men and Women after #metoo' from Rebel Wisdom.\n\nWarren Farrell has a unique perspective, from being one of the most high profile feminists in the 1970s, before writing a series of books that led to him being described as the 'father of the men's movement'. Now he leads couples counselling - helping women and men to listen to and understand each other.\n\nPart 1 of 'Men and Women after #metoo' is our podcast where we discuss the issues raised by these films in depth: https://youtu.be/1MdjtBp_BS8\n\nPart 2 is an exclusive interview with the director of the sleeper hit on the Men's Rights movement, the Red Pill Movie, Cassie Jaye, here: https://youtu.be/9uaCljuywkY\n\nTo see the second part of the interview with Warren Farrell - \"Men need to speak up!\", please support us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/rebelwisdom\n\nRebel Wisdom is running workshops for men and women to get a direct experience of the ideas in our films: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/events\n\nGet tickets for our London event 'Join the Great Intellectual Awakening' on 18 September here: https://www.tickettailor.com/events/rebelwisdom/193294 \n\nFind us on iTunes and Spotify, or visit rebelwisdom.podbean.com to download Rebel Wisdom as an audio podcast. \n\n---\n\nDr. Warren Farrell is the author of the just-published The Boy Crisis (with co-author John Gray). It exposes the boy crisis worldwide, as well as the causes and solutions that can be implemented by parents, schools and policy makers.\n\nDr. Farrell has been chosen by the Financial Times as one of the world\u2019s top 100 thought leaders. His books are published in over 50 countries, and in 20 languages. They include two award-winning international best-sellers, Why Men Are the Way They Are plus The Myth of Male Power.\n\n Warren was a pioneer in the women\u2019s movement as the only man elected three times to the Board of the National Organization for Women in NYC. He is currently Chair of the Coalition to Create a White House Council on Boys and Men, and a pioneer in the men\u2019s movement.\n\n Dr. Farrell\u2019s books contribute to 12 disciplines. A book on couples\u2019 communication, Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say, was a selection of the Book-of-the Month Club. His Father and Child Reunion has inspired many dads to be more involved with their children. And Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap--and What Women Can Do About It was chosen by U.S. News and World Report as one of the top four books on careers.\n\nWarren has taught at the university level in five disciplines, and appeared on more than 1,000 TV and radio shows, and been interviewed by Oprah, Barbara Walters, Peter Jennings, Katie Couric, Larry King, and Charlie Rose. He has been featured repeatedly in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. He has two daughters, and lives with his wife in Mill Valley, California, and virtually at www.warrenfarrell.com.",
