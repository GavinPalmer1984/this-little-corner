The film went viral, with hundreds of thousands of views. It also sparked polarised reactions - both for and against: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKLTVCJn6Q&t=5s\n\nThe creator of the film was conflict resolution expert Dr Hanna Milling. Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller sat down with Hanna, and contributors to the film Ilan Stefani and Stefana Bosse to ask them about the process of making the film and the reaction it has created. \n\nIn the film, Dr Milling called for a new dialogue between men and women. Hanna, David, Ilan and therapist Rafia Morgan attempted a new form of conversation: https://youtu.be/9CizXBr91Js\n\nThis is part of a series, 'Men and Women After #Metoo', which includes an exclusive interview with Warren Farrell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESiyb28fTQ4&t=1955s\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform asking the biggest questions: http://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/\n\nWe also run events for men and women to experience directly what we discuss in our films: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/events\n\nTo discuss the ideas in our films, join our Discord:
