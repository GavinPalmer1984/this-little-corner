 "description": "Sex and gender has become one of the most controversial and polarised topics in the culture. What can evolutionary psychology tell us about what men and women really want from each other, and is this becoming a taboo subject? \n\nEvolutionary psychologists Diana Fleischman and Geoffrey Miller discuss the war about masculinity, toxic femininity and more.\n\nAnd if the current cultural conversation looks a lot like a dysfunctional relationship between men and women, what does a healthy relationship look like?\n\nTo get access to an exclusive extra interview with Geoffrey on the 'Neurodiversity Case for Free Speech', and early access to the first interview with Geoffrey and Diana on polyamory - 'The Polyamorous Professors', and much more exclusive content, become a Rebel Wisdom subscriber: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nWe've also just launched the Rebel Wisdom store! Buy T Shirts and more on https://shop.rebelwisdom.co.uk\n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW",
