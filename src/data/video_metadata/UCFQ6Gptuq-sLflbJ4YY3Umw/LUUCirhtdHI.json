Philosopher Bernardo Kastrup holds doctorates in both philosophy and computer science, and has made a name for himself by arguing for metaphysical idealism, the idea that reality is essentially a mental phenomenon. \n\nIn this Showcase he'll explain why he's come to this conclusion, and why this age-old debate in philosophy can help us make sense of everything from how we practice science to how we navigate the meaning crisis.\n\nCheck out Bernardo's work on https://www.bernardokastrup.com/\n\nFollow him on Twitter @bernardokastrup\n\nParticipate in conversations like this in our Digital
