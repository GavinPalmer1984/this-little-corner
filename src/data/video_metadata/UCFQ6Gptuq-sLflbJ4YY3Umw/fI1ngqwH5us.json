Are we in some sense at war with ourselves?\n\nIain McGilchrist's book 'The Master and his Emissary' was a sensation. In it he drew a clear and compelling story of how the history of the western world was best viewed as a gradual takeover by the rational, logical left side of the brain, eclipsing the more holistic right brain. \n\nA film about his work will be released next year, 'The Divided Brain' - trailer here: https://vimeo.com/304915837\n\nRebel Wisdom is a platform for the biggest ideas around.
