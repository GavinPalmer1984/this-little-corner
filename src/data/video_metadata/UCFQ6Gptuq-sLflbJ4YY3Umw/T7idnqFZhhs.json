What can we make of Bret Weinstein's recent 'struggle session', and what might be possible in this new medium?\n\nRebel Wisdom is doing an increasing number of events on Clubhouse, search for our newly created club to join in.\n\nThe Justin Murphy piece referenced in the film is here: https://otherlife.co/the-meaning-of-clubhouse-vs-taylor-lorenz/\n\nTo join our digital campfire, check out our plans here: https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nThis was a Rebel Wisdom talk at The Stoa: https://www.thestoa.ca/", "duration": 2916, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "[Music]", "start": 0.0, "duration":
