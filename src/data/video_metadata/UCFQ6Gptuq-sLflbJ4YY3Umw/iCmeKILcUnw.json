 "description": "In Douglas Murray's recent bestseller, The Strange Death of Europe, he diagnoses a widespread cultural crisis in Europe, a continent that has fundamentally lost faith in itself. He is also part of the new loose grouping of public intellectuals known as the 'Intellectual Dark Web'.\n\nThis is a clip from full interview:  Cultural crisis and the Intellectual Dark Web, with Douglas Murray: https://youtu.be/MXS8qkHlhrs\n\nStrange Death of Europe: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strange-Death-Europe-Immigration-Identity/dp/1472942248\n\nRebel Wisdom is a new media platform founded on the conviction that we are seeing an ongoing and growing civilisational crisis, and the old operating systems break down. We can no longer trust the traditional media to make sense of the world. The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk",
