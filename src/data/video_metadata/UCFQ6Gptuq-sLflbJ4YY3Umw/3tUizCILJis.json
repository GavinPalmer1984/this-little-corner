A new conversation", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tUizCILJis", "date": "2018-06-02", "description": "Louise Mazanti and David Fuller's previous conversation on the excesses of the #metoo movement - featured in the 'Glitch in the Matrix' documentary - went viral, with over 250,000 people watching (various edits). Four months later, the sense that #metoo has gone too far is widespread, but no-one seems to know what to do next. What does a genuinely evolutionary conversation look like, where both women and men's experiences of the world are heard and valued? And what is Jordan Peterson's role in reviving the spirit of the masculine in the world? David and Louise try to sketch out the terrain.\n\nRebel Wisdom is hosting a real world event around these issues in London on Tuesday June 5th. Details and tickets here: http://buytickets.at/rebelwisdom/166218\n\nWe are also running men's weekend workshops to develop masculine presence: http://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/events/\n\nAnd will be running our first women's workshop in September: https://youtu.be/L3t7YcwB2GE\n\nTo help us make more of this great content - please consider supporting Rebel Wisdom on Patreon:
