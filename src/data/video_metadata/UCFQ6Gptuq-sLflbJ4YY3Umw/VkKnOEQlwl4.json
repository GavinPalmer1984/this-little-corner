 "description": "The question of who to trust, how we find truth and how we are being manipulated is central to understanding and solving all our other problems.\n\nThe pandemic crisis has acted like an amplifier and catalyst of all the existing fractures in culture. The question of reliable sensemaking is right at the core of resolving any of these problems.\n\nRebel Wisdom is beginning a series of films looking at the question of truth and sensemaking. Starting with a look back at one of the attempts to answer that question, the Intellectual Dark Web.\n\nLinks to films and articles mentioned in this piece.\n\nSam Harris & Jonathan Haidt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNyvn2w9Bns\n\nGlitch in the Matrix II, The Origin of the Intellectual Dark Web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKeMIWVOnbo\n\nMatt Taibbi, The American Press is Destroying Itself: https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself\n\nBari Weiss tweetstorm: https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1268628680797978625\n\nRyan Bennett on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ry_Nomad\n\nBret Weinstein & Heather Heying, Having a Real Conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBkF-xJh6tU&t=914s\n\nMike Nayna, Evergreen Trilogy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2WeWgcSMk&t=41s\n\nThe Intellectual Dark Web, an Integral Conversation?
