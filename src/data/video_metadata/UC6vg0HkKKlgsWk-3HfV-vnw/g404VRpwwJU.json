 "description": "#Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance #Pirsigs_Journey\n\nOne topic Dennis and I share interest is was Phaedrus' breakdown truly a  manifestation of psychosis, or what it enlightenment? Maybe it was both. Meditation provides insight during an altered state of consciousness,. Isn't that what happened? This opens up a debate into the nature of \"mental illness\". \n\n Dennis provides a beautiful description of the meditative process and its benefits.\n\nAlso, what is the relationship between Quality with Tao? Are they the same or different? In our culture,\u200b we remain tied to the scientific worldview. What did Pirsig\u200b think about this?\n\n\n\n\nLink to the full video at the end of this clip",
