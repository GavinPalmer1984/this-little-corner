 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrIPkBPjrrI",
 "date": "2021-12-18",
 "description": "Using the book \"Unknowable God\" by Diedre Carabine as a jumping off point, John describes his vision of coherence and harmony in science, spirituality and all manner of human endeavor under the influence of Neoplatonism. We can't go back and live as the ancient Greeks, but we can draw from this 1000 year tradition a rationality that uses all ways of knowing to give us full understanding of reality. John argues, and I agree, that it is this full understanding that is our best bet to address the Meaning Crisis.",
