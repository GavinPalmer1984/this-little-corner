 "description": "#vervaeke #pageau #meaning_crisis\nMy commentary on the John Vervaeke interview here - \nhttps://youtu.be/2PGglfl5j_I\non Jonathan Pageau's channel. Two approaches to Spirituality\u200b, one more traditionally Western, One that is an approach based on Cog-Sci and Buddhism. Both excellent depending on your temperament and inclination. Both excellent for the problems we face today. Both have Dynamic Quality!!\n\nI read from Chapter 6 of John's book here:\nhttps://books.openedition.org/obp/4274",
