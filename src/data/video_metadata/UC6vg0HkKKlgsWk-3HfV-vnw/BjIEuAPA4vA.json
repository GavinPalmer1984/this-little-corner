 "description": "In this chapter, there is more travel through the Dakotas, a brief exploration of Chris and of John\u2019s inability to relate to motorcycle maintenance, We learn a little more about the mysterious Phaedrus, we go into more depth about the Classic/Romantic split, and in doing so begin to\u200b enter Phaedrus\u2019 world. We also explore how systems are divided up and analyzed,  and in doing that, introduce the concept of the analytic knife with a demonstration, and begin to discuss how Phaedrus uses it.",
