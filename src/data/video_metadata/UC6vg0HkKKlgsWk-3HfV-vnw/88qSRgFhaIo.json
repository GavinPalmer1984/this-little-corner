 "date": "2021-11-15",
 "description": "In our third Convo, Christopher and I talk Chappelle. Christopher elucidates his form, use of paradox, irony and language among other observations and analyses. Meanwhile, I draw Pirsigian parallels and react to the master Brujo. \n\nChristopher is a scholar of Semiotics and author who works closely with John Vervaeke and drops in for Dialogos in this corner. He has a harmonious command of language, and a keen understanding of the underlying structures of communication.",
