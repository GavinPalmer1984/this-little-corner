 "description": "As a follow up to my last commentary on this interview of John Vervaeke by Jonathan Pageau in 2018, I try my best to associate their theories to Pirsig's MOQ, and other aspects of Pirsig's work. In doing so, I think I'm reflecting on more consonance between the 2. These are the kinds of worldviews that are useful to us during the information age. To see things in a materialistic way just leaves too much out, can't handle the information overload, and creates Platypi which we can't explain away. \n\nEric Dodson (worth watching the whole thing, lots of parallels\u200b): https://youtu.be/iluSqCY8Eb8\nPirsig's paper: http://moq.org/forum/Pirsig/emmpaper.html\nOne of many McWatt resources: https://philosophynow.org/issues/122/Robert_Pirsig_and_His_Metaphysics_of_Quality",
