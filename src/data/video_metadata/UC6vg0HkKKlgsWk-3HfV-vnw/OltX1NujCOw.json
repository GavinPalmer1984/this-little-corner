 "description": "Karen and I were going to focus our discussion on a couple of her latest convos, and to some degree we did - Glen inspired us to talk about emergence, and the reality of the process of computation as more real than what computation manifests. The Mark Solms convo took us into the realm of rat behavior in an experiment to understand addiction, and what that says about faith.  I'm cutting and pasting the followiing from Karen's upload of this video:\n\n Faith is the substance of things hoped for. We are meant to experience \"substance\", not \"substitutes\". The food is the hoped for thing. It becomes \"substance\" when it is provided by the Promiser, when the \nPromise is fulfilled, you could say, when the potential (the frame, the mesh, the matrix of possibility) is interpenetrated with the substance. The Promiser is the only one who knows when the food will actually arrive, but the addictable rats fall in love with the promise which is a poor substitute for the Promiser. The non-addictable rats trust that the Promiser will\ndeliver on the promise and provide the food. There is a verse in scripture, \"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live. It's not I, but Christ, who lives in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and died for me.\" It is by His faith that we are able to receive the \nsubstance of the thing hoped for. The poor addictable rats are sitting over there worshipping the golden calf while the rest of the Israelites are enjoying the manna from heaven (symbolically speakinig, of course, as these moments were not contemporaneous:-) Also, \"Every promise of God is 'Yes!' in Jesus Christ.\" The Promiser is greater than the promise.\n\nConversations being discussed here include:\nMark Solms on Consciousness:  https://youtu.be/9DoK7JdvGhU\u200b\nGlen's Episode 6 on Emergence: https://youtu.be/2m8kw8Q5Xf8\n\n Many more paths here.Me sure to check out her fantastic podcast channel \"The Meaning Code\": https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ",
