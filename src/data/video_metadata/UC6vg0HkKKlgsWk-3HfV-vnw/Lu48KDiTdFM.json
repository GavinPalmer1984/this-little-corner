 "description": "Zizek referenced a \"shocking\" revelation from the book Zen at War that Zen practices were encouraged  by the great historian of Zen DT Suzuki as methods to improve killing power as well as remove the perpetrator from the psychological impact of what they were doing. Chapter 7 of Mere Christianity by CS Lewis reflects  a common theme: that religion has a component that requires getting along in the real world, even during times of war and that the idealism we attribute to peaceful religions such as Buddhism and Christianity is\u200b just that, an ideal and are meant to guide personal spiritual growth. While these ideals are also the telos of their respective religion, during wartime what ensures survival for the group necessarily has to take precedence versus self sacrifice of individuals for their spiritual ideals.",
