 "description": "#darkhorsepodcast #zamm #heatherheyring\nhttps://youtu.be/RfNqk1bp8RQ?t=4704\n\nStarts Exploring Evolutionary Levels of Value\n\nHeather reads a couple of paragraphs from ZaMM in which Phaedrus is starting to work out the evolutionary levels of value he codifies in Lila. The Real University is not the buildings and legal corporate stuff, even though we more likely to see it in that SoM way. But it's a memorable concept to ZaMM readers in this form anyway, because it's lines up with what we know but probably never really thought about. Pirsig does that for us often.\n\nHere it is from chapter 13, expanded a little. \n\nPh\u00e6drus said the same confusion existed about the University and that was why loss of accreditation was hard to understand. The real University is not a material object. It is not a group of buildings that can be defended by police. He explained that when a college lost its accreditation, nobody came and shut down the school. There were no legal penalties, no fines, no jail sentences. Classes did not stop. Everything went on just as before. Students got the same education they would if the school didn\u2019t lose its accreditation. All that would happen, Ph\u00e6drus said, would simply be an official recognition of a condition that already existed. It would be similar to excommunication. What would happen is that the real University, which no legislature can dictate to and which can never be identified by any location of bricks or boards or glass, would simply declare that this place was no longer \"holy ground.\" The real University would vanish from it, and all that would be left was the bricks and the books and the material manifestation.\nIt must have been a strange concept to all of the students, and I can imagine him waiting for a long time for it to sink in, and perhaps then waiting for the question, What do you think the real University is?\nHis notes, in response to this question, state the following:\nThe real University, he said, has no specific location. It owns no property, pays no salaries and receives no material dues. The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location. It\u2019s a state of mind which is regenerated throughout the centuries by a body of people who traditionally carry the title of professor, but even that title is not part of the real University. The real University is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself.\nIn addition to this state of mind, \"reason,\" there\u2019s a legal entity which is unfortunately called by the same name but which is quite another thing. This is a nonprofit corporation, a branch of the state with a specific address. It owns property, is capable of paying salaries, of receiving money and of responding to legislative pressures in the process.\nBut this second university, the legal corporation, cannot teach, does not generate new knowledge or evaluate ideas. It is not the real University at all. It is just a church building, the setting, the location at which conditions have been made favorable for the real church to exist.\nConfusion continually occurs in people who fail to see this difference, he said, and think that control of the church buildings implies control of the church. They see professors as employees of the second university who should abandon reason when told to and take orders with no backtalk, the same way employees do in other corporations.  \nThey see the second university, but fail to see the first.\nI remember reading this for the first time and remarking about the analytic craftsmanship displayed. He avoided splitting the University into fields or departments and dealing with the results of that analysis. He also avoided the traditional split into students, faculty and administration.\nWhen you split it either of those ways you get a lot of dull stuff that doesn\u2019t really tell you much you can\u2019t get out of the official school bulletin. But Ph\u00e6drus split it between \"the church\" and \"the location,\" and once this cleavage is made the same rather dull and imponderable institution seen in the bulletin suddenly is seen with a degree of clarity that wasn\u2019t previously available. On the basis of this cleavage he provided explanations for a number of puzzling but normal aspects of University life.",
