 "description": "#Robert_M_Pirsig #Metaphysics_of_Quality #MOQ\n\n\u201cHe had a big nose and poor posture and wasn\u2019t anything to look at, and tended to relate poorly to other people. The one on the left who looked like she had been giggling the loudest was Lila. The same face, exactly\u2009\u2014\u2009gold hair and smooth complexion and blue eyes\u2009\u2014\u2009with a smothered smile she probably thought covered up what she was laughing at\u201d -Excerpt From: Robert M. Pirsig. \u201cLila. An Inquiry Into Morals.\u201d \n\nLila was not near as popular as Zamm, therefore, audiobook is difficult to find.  So I decided to make one. I'm reading the whole book, Lila, loading one chapter at a time. This will accompany some analysis videos of the text as we move on from how the philosophy is presented in Zamm to how it is more codified and explained in Lila. Warning: I'm not the great Michael Kramer, the actor who read ZaMM, so this reading is a little more LibraVox than Audible, still...it's all correct and should suffice. \n\nI will attempt weekly readings. There are a few minor errors, such as \"that\" instead of \"the\", or \"Rigel had said\" vs \"Rigel said\" I did make one correction with text where it was important.",
