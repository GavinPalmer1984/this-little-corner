 "description": "What we understand to be unchangeable laws of reality are neither laws nor unchangeable. They are the best we can do to explain reality at the time. According to Pirsig, the Law of Gravity is a ghost - invented by Newton in the 17th century and is no more real than any other ghost. Vervaeke demonstrates that what has long believed to be absolute - Newton's causality theory of change is not absolute at all. In fact, it was preceded by Aristotle's forms, and is being supplanted by the embracing of dynamical systems theory, and perhaps even integrating Aristotle for a more holistic understanding of change that transcends our present understanding, but includes the best of the past. \n\nThe way of the Brujo, of the Shaman is to encourage the integration of their psychotechnologies. This is how they become ghosts. The better the ghosts, the longer they live on within us. Cognitive science is giving us a lens in which to comprehend how these Shamanic practices work on us!  By the way,  Dale Carnegie was a Shaman whose psychotechnology was persuasion. \n\nSo how do we determine what is real? As the materialist worldview is coming up short, I think the question is becoming, how do we determine what's Good\n\nMaterial used in this video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/C1AaqD8t3pk\nhttps://youtu.be/A_gH5VIZO0Q\nhttps://youtu.be/ClA9wO8GaqQ\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chaos-byGleick-Gleick/dp/B006ODJS50/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=chaos+gleick&qid=1556460032&s=gateway&sr=8-6",
