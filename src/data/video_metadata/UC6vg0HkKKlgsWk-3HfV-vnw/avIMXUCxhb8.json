 "date": "2019-03-31",
 "description": "I really picked up on a couple of points (truth, novelty) Wilber made that resonated with my study of the Metaphysics of Quality. Also, true meditative consciousness usually has to be cultivated, but once you do that, you can see the truth of all 4 of the Integral Theory Quadrants. This type of consciousness can be cultivated or it can happen instantly.",
