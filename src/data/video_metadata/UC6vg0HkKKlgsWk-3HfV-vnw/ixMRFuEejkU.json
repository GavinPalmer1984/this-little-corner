 "description": "I'm discussing Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance chapter by chapter. I will be using the Bantam pink paperback edition, as the more important analyses and reference material pertaining to Zamm uses it. So, I encourage you to join me in this, because by reading or re-reading Pirsig\u2019s novels, we will be able to get a handle on how his philosophy, the Metaphysics of Quality unfolded. I also want to relate what we read to things going on in our world today, which potentially can help us better understand the occurrences and experiences.",
