 "description": "John Vervaeke has a thought-provoking take on the flow state. He gives it more credit for the Good than anyone so far that I have seen, plus he describes ways to implement it which could be very beneficial therapeutically. Pirsig called the flow state \"gumption\", and the great neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp\u200b called it enthusiasm, without which we are depressed. \n\nVervaeke - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis #2: https://youtu.be/aF9HeXg65AE\nMy blog: https://aqualityexistence.com/2018/07/08/zamms-practical-advice-from-the-philosophical-gumption-and-its-traps/\nMaps: https://maps.org",
