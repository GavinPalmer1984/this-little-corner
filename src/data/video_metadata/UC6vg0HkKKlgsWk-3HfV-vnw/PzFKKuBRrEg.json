 "description": "This chapter explores how we understand reality and how that understanding is conveyed by our culture primarily through language. It also shows how our reality is based on convention, not ultimate reality. Which is of course why Phaedrus proposes a more inclusive metaphysics.\n\nI\u2019m going to approach this chapter differently by actually naming what I think might have been the tabs on the notecards Pirsig used for this chapter. The tabs are:\n\nPhilosophology\nWilliam James\nMoQ Philosophy of Insanity\nInsanity - Culturally Defined\nCulturally Reality - Sanity\nStatic Filter\nThe Dharmakaya Light \n\nDr. Anthony McWatt's Dissertation: https://cdn.website-editor.net/90e0cb600d8146f9af85b88f0c2f8fb2/files/uploaded/A.McWatt-PhD%2520Thesis%2520June%25202011%2520pp.pdf\n\nCrazy Like Us: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416587098?pf_rd_r=V4W8Y1D2AKBVAHKK8R5G&pf_rd_p=8fe9b1d0-f378-4356-8bb8-cada7525eadd&pd_rd_r=f61f4ea3-61ce-4782-81cd-982798b4565e&pd_rd_w=MFARx&pd_rd_wg=RHCSq&ref_=pd_gw_unk\n\nVervaeke, Mastropietro & Miscevic: Zombies in Western Culture: https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/602",
