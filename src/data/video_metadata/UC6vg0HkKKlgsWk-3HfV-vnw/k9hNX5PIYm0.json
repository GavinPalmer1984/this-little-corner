 "description": "In a lot of ways, this is the conclusion of the book...DQ is given the place of honor, but SQ's place is respected...and in more mundane ways than you probably hoped. I guess in a lot of way, this chapter addresses the way human consciousness interacts with this world we've been given...and what the optimal way of doing so is. \n\nPheadrus has first hand knowledge of insanity...and of mysticsm. Now he's put in a situation where maybe he can provide to Lila what was denied him...although that chilling out time in the psych ward wasn't a bad thing...but you can do that on a boat as well. Probably he's giving Lila the benefit of the doubt on the most fundamental of levels. \n\nReally dense and rich and beautiful chapter...my mumblings don't begin to do it justice. Read it!",
