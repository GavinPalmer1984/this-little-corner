 "description": "Ken Wilber, Jordan Peterson and Robert Pirsig all have formulated \"Theories of Everything\" whose underlying metaphysics see patterns rather than subjects/objects. In this video, I will briefly describe their basic \"maps\", what each believe is the current pathology in consciousness, and what is the road to repair. I will also try to describe their notions of reality. \n\nAs I become gradually more comfortable with Pirsig's work, I feel a little more at ease with comparing and integrating MOQ with the work of other scholars that have influenced me over the years. It seems to me we could really use ways of looking at the world that are healing rather than divisive, and I think the work of all three gentlemen are that. \n\nThe prominent scholar of Pirsig seems to be Anthony McWatt, who obtained his PhD in the  Metaphysics of Quality in 2005 (a little more than a decade ago, that I wrongly estimated). His work is very useful for understanding the Metaphysics of Quality, and a variety of his published works are online, including his thesis. I hope you check out his work as well. \nhttps://www.pirsigsjourney.com/dr-anthony-mcwatt\nhttps://www.pirsig.org/dr-anthony-mcwatt-phd.html\n\nI will soon post a second video where I discuss some more psychological and spiritual\u200b elements. Basically, this video commentary is on the first half of the documentary, and part 2 will be on the second half.\n\nhttps://www.minds.com/aqualityexistence",
