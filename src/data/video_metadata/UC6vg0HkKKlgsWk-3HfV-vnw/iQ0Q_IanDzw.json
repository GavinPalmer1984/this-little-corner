 "description": "#zen_and_the_art_of_motorcycle_maintenance #henry_gurr #bozeman_montana\n\nReflections on Zamm and the actual journey with Lee Glover, who has helped this channel greatly with insights and footage. We talk motorcycles, DeWeese's, art, and Bob Pirsig\u200b - basically (extra smart) regular guy in a lot of ways. Right on time for chapter 14 on Sunday\n\nLee's in Bozeman to attend Henry Gurr's (Pirsig Archivist Extradanaire) book signing for \"A Woman of Quality\" a biography of Sarah Vinke, who started Phaedrus' whole inquiry into Quality. You can find the book here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1732871809/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new\n\nHere's a little footage from the Chautauqua we mentioned: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvzq17ypmTI&t=244s",
