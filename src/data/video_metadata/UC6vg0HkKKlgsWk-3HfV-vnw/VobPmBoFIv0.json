 "description": "Rehashing why MOQ is a philosophy that was before its time, but not anymore. Like Many geniuses, RMP was a visionary who was articulating a philosophy that appealed to many, But, Like Wilber's Integral Theory fell out of fashion. I think we should seriously consider bringing MOQ back into the dialog. We need guidance to maneuver all this information. Our consciousness is in transition, as evidenced by a more mythic, experiential, subjective or however you want to describe it, approach that is emerging from powerful thinkers. Also, shall we start a book club with Pirsig's books? For me, it is challenging to find enough locals for a meetup on these older books that so far are not back in vogue, but we can \"meetup\" online.\n\nMy blog with transcripts etc. \nhttps://wordpress.com/post/aqualityexistence.com/87",
