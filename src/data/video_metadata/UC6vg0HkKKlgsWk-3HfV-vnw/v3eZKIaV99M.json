 "description": "A hundred years before Pirsig struggled to have his philosophy acknowledged in academia, Tolstoy reached many of the same conclusions. \nPirsig retreats into nature to write a literary realistic work that communicates his understanding of reality. Tolstoy, in the natural splendor of his massive country estate reaches many of the same conclusions as Pirsig. \n\nTolstoy writes Anna Karenina, his masterpiece of literary realism to communicate his understanding of philosophy to the world. Reason is not the foundation of our world, reason is a swindler that keeps us from seeing what we already know as children, before we are blinded to truth by the analytical knife. \n\nBoth authors extensively studied formal philosophy and could have written a formal philosophical work. They chose instead to embed their philosophical understandings in powerful stories, and the rest is well known history.\nTolstoy has reached at least 400 million printed copies of his works, and Pirsig has reached at least 50 million. This tells us something about philosophical writing. If you want to communicate a philosophy, it reaches far more people in a powerful story than an academic dissertation.\nTolstoy and Pirsig are both in their own way articulating the same themes about the meaningful life.",
