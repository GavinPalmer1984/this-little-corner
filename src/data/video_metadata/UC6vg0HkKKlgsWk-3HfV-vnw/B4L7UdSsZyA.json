 "description": "The fact that a 14-year-old girl is a wildly popular pundit demonstrates that real-world experience of events is not required to be a successful commentator. Rather, like an academic literature review, reading and viewing the news is all that is necessary. This results in pundits on either side rehashing pre-packaged narratives that often have little to do with on the ground events. Soph is a beguiling prodigy delivering high-quality\u200b content when she speaks from her experience, but her political commentary, while humorous and compelling, is more divisive punditry ripe for potential exploitation, due to its novelty, by interested agents who act as though she is not a child. \n\nThe more deftly crafted these polarizing presentations, the more of a dopamine kick they deliver to acolytes - further distancing the possibility\u200b of nuanced thinking. This, in turn, leads to more polarization and to the culture wars, which is unfortunate because each side needs the other for all of us to progress. Regression back to a tribal social pattern is low Quality.\n\nBret Weinstein on Overton window: https://youtu.be/Uejg7f3IpZU",
