 "description": "Is right and wrong knit into the fabric of the universe, or is morality fluid and pragmatic? According to what I understand from Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality, so far, it's both and neither. It's not about right and wrong as much as when is the right time for change and how that need evolves.\u00a0\n\nRev. Cynthia Bourgeault is a powerful Christian intellectual and a mystic who has something to say about the Law of Three that mirrors aspects of the MOQ. The relationship between 2 static patterns are transformed by the introduction of Dynamic to create a new and much better thing that transcends the 2 alone. \n\nRev Bourgeault's original video:  https://youtu.be/2FhgrGKIirc\n\nCAC is an excellent organization that is reexamining Christianity in a Dynamic way, and you might consider subscribing to them.",
