 "description": "Jonathan Pageau kindly invited me onto his channel for a conversation - which was so enjoyable and eye-opening. Paul VanderKlay did a great response video. I'm just having some reflections on that, plus talking about some concepts that this conversation made me think about, and elaborating on some other ideas, chaos (dynamical systems) theory, the train metaphor in Zamm, more on Poincare, romanticism, and reflecting more on John Vervaeke's work.",
