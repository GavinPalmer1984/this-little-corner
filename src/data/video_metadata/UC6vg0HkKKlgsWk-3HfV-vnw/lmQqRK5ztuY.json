 "description": "Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality (and his work in general) holds what I believe to be a key to updating our moral framework to handle the information age. It's time to see the world in terms of patterns rather than objects...and to understand that an objective Truth is not possible, but a process of arriving at the truth in any given situation is, and the MOQ can guide us.\u00a0\n\nYoutube is a plethora of Brujo's helping us navigate this transition into a new Human Consciousness, and it's exciting!!\n\nScott Adams on the Well: https://youtu.be/oalrfTbli68",
