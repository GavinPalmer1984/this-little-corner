Dr Mario Baghos is Lecturer in Theology (Patristics) and Church History at St Andrew\u2019s Greek Orthodox Theological College (Sydney College of Divinity). Dr. Baghos has a PhD in Studies in Religion from the University of Sydney (2015). He has written a book called \u201cFrom the Ancient Near East to Christian Byzantium\u201d wherein he explores the symbolism of the foundations of Constantinople and ancient civilizations. This discussion is a continuation of my first interview with Richard Rohlin (A Universal History: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N5s4n_lwB8&t=567s) where we talked about history through the more mythical, symbolic lens.\n\nIn this interview Mario and I discuss the importance of Constantinople, the \u201csecond Rome\u201d, as the first city founded upon a Christian vision of the cosmos, by Saint Constantine the Great after his conversion to Christianity. We discuss the legends around the founding of the city, its forgotten spiritual and cultural influence, its connection with Troy and role in the universal history as well as the preservation of ancient pagan texts and statuary and their place in a Christian hierarchy.\n\nMario\u2019s book, From the Ancient Near East to Christian Byzantium: Kings, Symbols, and Cities: \n-Amazon:
