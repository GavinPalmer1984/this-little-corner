With emerging technologies it's become possible to artificially create hybrids of different types of animals, or even to interbreed between humans and animals. A recent development at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California has sparked public debate given their experimentation with a monkey-human hybrid embryo. The ancient word for such a hybrid is chimera. Like the sphinx and cherubim these mixed beings indicate a breakdown and confusion of identity and act as a buffer between existence and non-existence. What can the (quite literal) emergence of chimeras tell us about the state of our world today?\n\nRod Dreher's article on the topic: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/monkey-man-embryos/\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nThe outro to my videos was written by Matthew Wilkinson\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/", "duration": 777, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "Not very long ago, Rod Dreher, from \"The", "start": 0.0, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "American Conservative\",", "start": 1.76, "duration": 1.36}, {"text": "as well as a few other media outlets,\npublished a comment on", "start": 3.12, "duration": 4.198}, {"text": "an article, on a scholarly\narticle, that talked about", "start": 7.318, "duration": 2.682}, {"text": "creating a human-monkey\nhybrid in an embryo form;", "start": 10.0, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "and they talk about how they did it - you\nknow the case -", "start": 16.48, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "and they even use the word \"chimera\",\nwhich is the ancient word they used to", "start": 19.6, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "talk about these\nmythical monsters that were a mixture", "start": 24.8, "duration": 3.039}, {"text": "between different types\nof beings.
