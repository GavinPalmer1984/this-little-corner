Andrew Damick", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U7c_89FeWM", "date": "2021-09-15", "description": "Fr. Andrew Stephen Damick is Chief Content Officer of Ancient Faith Ministries. He has been podcasting since 2007 and is host of the Orthodox Engagement, Amon S\u00fbl, Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy, and Roads from Emmaus podcasts, and co-host of The Lord of Spirits and The Areopagus Podcast.\n\nToday we talk about his new book, Arise O God: The Gospel of Christ\u2019s Defeat of Demons, Sin, and Death (see link below). It is a very interesting and succinct introduction to a more cosmic and narrative vision of the Gospel and it captures much of what he and Fr. Stephen De Young have been discussing on the Lord of Spirits Podcast.\n\nWe discuss what motivated Fr. Andrew to write this book, the cosmic VS sales-pitch visions of Christianity, the cosmic reality of demons and becoming \u201clike the angels\u201d and individualism and spiritual progress. In the second half we also talk about Fr. Andrew\u2019s studies of mythology, pagan literature, and modern VS ancient paganism. Enjoy!\n\n-Fr.
