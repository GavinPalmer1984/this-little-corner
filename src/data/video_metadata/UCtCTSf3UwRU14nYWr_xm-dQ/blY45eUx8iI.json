 "description": "One of the big problems people face today regarding religion or the notion of God, is the problem of what I would call the reality of God VS the reality of the world. This might seem abstract at first, but it ends up manifesting itself in everybody\u2019s life, whether they\u2019re religious or not. It ends up manifesting itself in opposites; on the one hand there is the argument of transcendence; that God is completely above the world. While on the other hand there is immanence; that God completely fills the world. Understanding this problem can help us understand some of the discourse people are using, and how we often feel trapped in extreme opposites. \n\n==========================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:50 Framing of the problem\n09:48 How we are dealing with this\n12:00 The solution\n15:28 St. Dionysius the Areopagite\n21:35 Conclusion\n24:37 Outro\n\n==========================\n\n-The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n-Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n-Orthodox Arts Journal: https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/jonathan-pageau/\n-My brother's book on symbolism - Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n-Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n-Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n-Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n-French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\n-Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n-Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n-Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n-The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n-Webside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n-Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n-Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n-Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n-Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n-Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",
