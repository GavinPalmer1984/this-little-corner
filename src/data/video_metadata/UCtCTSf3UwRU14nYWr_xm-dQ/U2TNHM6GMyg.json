Peterson.\nhttps://youtu.be/KVo5hq64B2M\n\nFor more on St-Maximos, I recommend the book by fr.Andrew Louth: \nhttps://azbyka.ru/otechnik/assets/uploads/books/18404/Andrew%20Louth%20Maximus%20the%20Confessor%20Early%20Church%20Fathers.pdf   For man as microcosm and the place where all of creation comes together, see from page 69: The division of Being.   \n\nAlso for more detailed reading, here is a paper that deal with the Anthropic Theology of St-Maximos and relates it to the Anthropic notion of modern physics.  http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_3/06-01-jirrs3-bahrim.pdf\n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/PageauCarvings", "duration": 657, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "[Music]", "start": 0.53, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "and so st.
