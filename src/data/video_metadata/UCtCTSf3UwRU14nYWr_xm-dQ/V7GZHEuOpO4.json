From kneeling and chanting to contrition and acts of communion, the protests used catharsis as a means to a form of religious ecstasy, which was made more intense because of the Covid-19 lockdown.   We even look at the trope of Human Sacrifice appearing in the narrative.  \n\nSupport this channel: \nhttps://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\npatreon:
