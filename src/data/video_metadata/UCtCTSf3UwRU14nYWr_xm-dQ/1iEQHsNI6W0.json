 "description": "The 20th century has both wielded an absolute assault on Christianity and its artistic tradition, but in the darkest moment, a few flames were lit, and the traditions were reborn, spawning a new liturgical art which is flowering and still gaining strength today.  \n\nLooking at the first glimmers like Leonid Ouspenky, Fotis Kontoglou and then moving towards the more recent artists, I finish by showing some of my own work and relating how my own story mirrors the general rediscovery of the ancient Christian Tradition.  \n\nThis talk was given at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Saskatoon as part of their Rebuilding Catholic Culture series. \n\nOrthodox Arts Journal: www.orthodoxartsjournal.org\nMy carving websie: www.pageaucarvings.com\n\nMy links:  \n\nSupport: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nSubscribestart: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonatha...\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nThe podcast: https://soundcloud.com/jonathan-pagea...\nwebsite: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicW...\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/\n\nThe music at the opening is Russian Eastern Overture, by Rimsky Korsakov.",
