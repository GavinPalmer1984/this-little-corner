 "description": "As a complement to my Clown World video, I will look at a traditional story in which the wizard Merlin appears as a hysterically laughing wildman who restores the world by his laughter.  This is found in The Romance of Silence, a thirteenth century Arthurian Romance which has come to prominence in recent times.  \n\nSorry for the lack of editing, I am still nomadic myself.
