Henok Elias is an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian and has a YouTube channel called Philosophy of Art & Science. Many listeners recommended I talk with him for an insider perspective on the particulars of Ethiopian Orthodox traditions. See below for links to the universal history symbolism about Ethiopia I\u2019ve discussed with Richard Rohlin that led up to this conversation.\n\nDn. Henok and I discuss his place in the church, training and poetry in the Ethiopian tradition, what his perspective is on the discussions about Ethiopia on this channel, patron saints, feasts, Lalibela churches as the \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d, the role of drum instruments in the Ethiopian church and finally I ask his opinion about the future role of Ethiopia in the universal history. \n\n-Dn.
