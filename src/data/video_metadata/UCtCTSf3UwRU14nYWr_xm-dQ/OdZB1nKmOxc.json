The subject of the conference was The New Media, and the other speakers included Jordan Peterson, Bret Weinstein and Theryn Meyer.  \n\nI spoke of the recent emergence of a new band of media pundits who have rallied around free speech, figures like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Dave Rubin, Sargon of Akkad, Ben Shapiro, Gad Saad and many others.  I discuss how a world becomes upside down as it exhausts itself and the role of the outliers and tricksters in putting the world back on its feet.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon:
