 "description": "This is a talk on Religious Symbolism and Sacred Art given at King's College University in February 2015 by Jonathan Pageau, Orthodox liturgical artist and editor of the Orthodox Arts Journal.  \n\nhttp://www.pageaucarvings.com \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nSacred Symbol, Sacred Art\n\nThe rediscovery of ancient Christian symbolism and the worldview which flows from the web of its analogies can be a source of new life for the Christian artist. This symbolism is not only present in the content and message, but in the forms, the mediums and the very uses of art. Christian art can be a true and honest engagement within the contemporary world, one which neither ignores the visual and conceptual revolutions of the last centuries nor attempts to paste the Christian message on forms and aesthetics which negate this very message..  \n---------------------------------------------------------",
