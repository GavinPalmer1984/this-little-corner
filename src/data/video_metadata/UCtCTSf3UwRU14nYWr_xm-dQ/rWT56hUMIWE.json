 "description": "The Matrix has come to permeate much of our social discourse today. The movie is full of symbolic references, but most importantly it is the structure of the movie which gives us most insight about what it is the Wachowski siblings are painting for us, a battle between tyranny and freedom which can also be seen as order and chaos.  In the end, the Matrix still speaks clearly to many of the questions being asked today.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",
