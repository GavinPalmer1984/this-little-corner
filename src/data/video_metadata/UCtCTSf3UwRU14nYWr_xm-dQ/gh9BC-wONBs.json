While my first video was about the beasts in Revelation (https://youtu.be/-wchjSeB5Oo), now we will attempt to understand the Mark of the Beast. But to understand the Mark of the Beast we must first understand what a mark is in general. In this video I discuss this very primordial symbolism, starting with its origins in Scripture and how it\u2019s related to accounting, technology, identification, and, yes, medicine.\n\nRelated
