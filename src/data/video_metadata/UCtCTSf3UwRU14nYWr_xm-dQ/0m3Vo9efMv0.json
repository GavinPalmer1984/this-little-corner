"date": "2020-04-20", "description": "The opening scene of the Dark Knight movie by Christopher Nolan is one of the best examples of revolution and can help us understand contemporary phenomena like cancel culture. \n\nIn that scene, the Joker played by Heath Ledger orchestrates a bank heist which also becomes a statement for what the Joker stands for and establishes him as the King of an upside down clown hierarchy.  \n\nThis video was edited by Thomas Wijnaendts van Resandt of the Storytellers channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbphDfwSJmxk1Ny_3Oicrng\n \nSupport this channel:
