He is a the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in the Catholic Church. He's also an author, speaker, theologian, and founder of Word on Fire, a global media ministry.\n\nI finally had the opportunity to talk with him in the wake of the recent \"Four Horsemen of Meaning\" discussion on Jordan Peterson's channel (linked below). We discuss the current opening up in culture and return to topics like meaning and the more mystical and participative aspects of Christianity. The problems of atheism, iconoclasm, social justice, ethics, the critical historical approach to religion, addiction and finally the church fathers that have inspired us.\n\n- The Four Horsemen of
