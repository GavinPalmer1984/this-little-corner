I explore the symbolism surrounding this Christmas tradition and how it shows us the purpose of extra-biblical traditions.\n\nIt connects with notions of the incarnation,  purity and how extreme elements are brought together in Christ.   \n\nFor more on this, please check two  of my article. \n\n- The Ass and the Ox in the Nativity Icon:
