 "description": "This is my fourth discussion with Richard Rohlin, philologist and co-host of the Amon S\u00fbl podcast. We continue our exploration of universal history, picking up where we left off last episode with the special symbolic significance of Ethiopia (https://youtu.be/czy7MnDXOO0).\n\nIn this episode we address some responses we\u2019ve received on the universal history series. We discuss the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius more in depth, the role of Ethiopia in medieval history, the magic gates of Alexander the Great and Alexander\u2019s connection to Ethiopia and the apocalypse, hybridity and we also hint at the symbolism of the US, in particular the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n===================== \n\nETHIOPIAN CROSS MERCH: \nEthiopian Cross (WHITE) apparel: https://the-symbolic-world.creator-spring.com/listing/ethiopian-cross-white \nEthiopian Cross (BLACK) apparel: https://www.thesymbolicworld.store/listing/ethiopian-cross-black?product=2 \n\n===================== \n\nBooks and podcasts mentioned:\n-Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.
