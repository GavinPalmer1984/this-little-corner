These famous passages can help us understand how Christ is not only the \u201ctop of the hierarchy\u201d, so to speak, but He also fills it, and provides the means for others to participate in creation as microcosms of Himself. It\u2019s also important to understand the surrounding context of the Beatitudes and how they fit into the bigger image of who Christ is.\n\nRemember to like and subscribe if you enjoy these kinds of
