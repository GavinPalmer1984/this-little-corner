 "description": "This is my second interview with Richard Rohlin, philologist and co-host of the Amon S\u00fbl podcast. We continue to explore history through the symbolic lens, paying particular attention to the images of Christ and Antichrist. Throughout our conversation we draw on the Book of Revelation and the Sibylline Oracles, discussing Mithradates VI of Pontus, the Roman Emperor Nero and his return as an antichrist figure, the Arthurian legends and the combination of violent tyranny and decadence as manifestations of the end of a world.
