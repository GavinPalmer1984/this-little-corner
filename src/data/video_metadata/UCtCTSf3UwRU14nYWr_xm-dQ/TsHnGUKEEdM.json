 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsHnGUKEEdM",
 "date": "2018-09-24",
 "description": "The traditional icon of the last judgement is a very complex image which is both the synthesis of Christian typology as well as an image of the eschatological finality of all things.  It is basically an image of the structure of reality.\n\nAll the elements of the icon are analyzed in light of the structure of being and how we participate in its unfolding.  \n\nThe image interpreted was painted by fr. Luke Dingman and can be purchased at Orthodox Images:  http://www.orthodoximages.com/feasts_other.html\n\nThe talk was given as St-john Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church in Seattle.  \n\nMy links:  \npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",
