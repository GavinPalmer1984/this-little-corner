 "description": "This is my third conversation about universal history with Richard Rohlin, philologist and co-host of the Amon S\u00fbl podcast. We are very excited to discuss Ethiopia and its unique role in the universal history. We draw a lot on Scripture: the Queen of Sheba, Moses' Ethiopian wife and the Ethiopian eunuch mentioned in Acts. This topic is all about the symbolism of the margins, encountering the stranger and the flip that can happen at the end of something. Also relevant is the role of the feminine and in particular the foreign woman.\n\nStay tuned for our follow-up talk where we will see the role of Ethiopia in medieval universal history and its connections with Alexander the Great. \n\nUniversal history playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVX4HUUPrIY_M2uZP3yW6EEiod3fGD6FD\n\n=====================\n\nETHIOPIAN CROSS MERCH:\nEthiopian Cross (WHITE) apparel: https://the-symbolic-world.creator-spring.com/listing/ethiopian-cross-white\nEthiopian Cross (BLACK) apparel: https://www.thesymbolicworld.store/listing/ethiopian-cross-black?product=2\n\n=====================\n\nFilm mentioned:\n-The Ten Commandments film (1956) featuring Charlton Heston: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/\n\nPodcasts mentioned:\n-Fr.
