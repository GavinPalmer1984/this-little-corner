 "description": "I interview American cartoonist and children\u2019s book illustrator Ben Hatke, about storytelling and graphic novels. We talk a lot about the evolution of stories, how we make them our own, how modern superhero comics compare with ancient mythology, whether the story of Christ stands apart and above other stories, with a monopoly on certain storytelling tropes.
