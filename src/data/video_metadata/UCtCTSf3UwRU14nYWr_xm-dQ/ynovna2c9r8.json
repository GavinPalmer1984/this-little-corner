 "title": "Universal History: Extreme Ethiopia | with Richard Rohlin",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynovna2c9r8",
 "date": "2021-09-08",
 "description": "This is my third and final Universal History discussion with Richard Rohlin on the topic of Ethiopia. Today we will look at several Ethiopian practices and how they ultimately manifest the two roles of Ethiopia as both the \u201ccontainer\u201d, or the Ark, and the extreme. We discuss the importance of personhood in culture and the role of the saints, before we dive into different themes in Ethiopian tradition and hagiography that include a focus on the 9 Roman Saints we mentioned last time, the good thief, the saint as punisher, the scandalous aspect of salvation regarding cannibalism and the Eucharist, and much more.
