We talk about the \"universal history\" - ancient people understood themselves to part of fundamentally the same world approachable through different identities and particularities in time. The modern world has lost this natural coherence and instead sees identity and narrative as tyrannical and/or arbitrary. Richard and I talk about hagiography, the Middle Ages as our cultural backdrop, syncretism and how we can rediscover a shared and coherent narrative by understanding historical events symbolically.\n\nRichard\u2019s work:\n- Richard Rohlin\u2019s article on The Symbolic World blog: https://thesymbolicworld.com/articles/folk-stories-traditions/the-symbolism-of-st-dionysius-the-areopagite/\n- Amon S\u00fbl podcast (Exploring the Tolkien Legendarium with the Christian Faith): https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/amonsul\n- Amid Weeping There is Joy: https://www.amazon.com/Amid-Weeping-There-Joy-Perspectives/dp/1951536126\n- 7 & 8 May 2021 Doxamoot online conference: https://store.ancientfaith.com/doxamoot/\n\nBooks and podcasts mentioned:\n- Apocalypse.
