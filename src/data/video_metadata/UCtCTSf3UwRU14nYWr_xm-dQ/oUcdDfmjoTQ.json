 "description": "This talk was given at the Northwest Catholic Family Education Center on October 27-28, 2017 with Jordan Peterson and other speakers.  http://nwcatholicconference.com/\n\nThere is a vigorous return to liturgical art happening today. This movement to rediscover the ancient language of the West can be understood in secular terms and as a natural consequence of an exhaustion in the revolutionary understanding of how art develops.  \n\nIn this talk I use Camille Paglia as one secular thinker who understands how sacred art is the source out of which the arts can be reinvigorated.\n\nLInks:\n\nOrthodox Arts Journal\nhttps://www.orthodoxartsjournal.org/\n\nMy carving workshop\nhttp://www.hexaemeron.org/carving\n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",
