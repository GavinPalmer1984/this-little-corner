 "description": "This video is a repost from a discussion I had with Sam Glenn, whose YouTube channel is dedicated to exploring philosophy. We discuss the symbolic reality of the bodies and agency of cities as principalities. Viewers might find it complementary to last my discussion with John Vervaeke, linked below. Sam and I also talk about how authority ideally functions, and modernity's relationship to authority, hierarchy and technology.
