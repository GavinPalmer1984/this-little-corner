 "description": "In this video I interview Gauthier Pierozak about the amazing work he\u2019s done to rediscover and share the lost work of the 20th century French symbolist, Louis Charbonneau-Lassay. Charbonneau was a Catholic archaeologist who also collaborated with Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, but remained dedicated to approaching symbolism through primarily a Christian lens. He was particularly interested in how all of the natural world - plants, animals, minerals etc. - participate in symbolically representing different aspects of God. \n\nGauthier reconstructed Charbonneau\u2019s book, The Vulnerary of Christ, which was translated into English. He also made publicly available many of the previously lost notes of Charbonneau:\n\n-French archives of the work of Louis Charbonneau-Lassay: https://www.archives-charbonneau-lassay.org\n-Gauthier Pierozak on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gauthierpierozak/\n\nBooks:\n-The Vulnerary of Christ: The Mysterious Emblems of the Wounds in the Body and Heart of Jesus Christ: https://www.amazon.com/Vulnerary-Christ-Mysterious-Emblems-Wounds/dp/1621386767/\n-The Bestiary of Christ by Louis Charbonneau-Lassay: https://www.amazon.com/Bestiary-Christ-Louis-Charbonneau-Lassay/dp/0140194495/\n-Le Bestiaire du Christ (A.M.
