The entire series was about the challenges and opportunities of two extremes, unlimited variability on one side and absolute control and linearity on the other. This whole problem culminates into the last episode, which was brought into an almost theological realm as the entire climax of the series became a play on Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden facing the puzzle of the serpent. In this video I explore the final episode and the general tendency in both the MCU and DC to move towards the trope of the multiverse in their storytelling. Just a fair warning: spoilers are definitely ahead.\n\nThe video was edited by Stefan Klonowski\n\n-The Symbolic World Website and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n-Merch:
