 "description": "Dr. Nathan Jacobs is a filmmaker, artist, scholar, writer and Orthodox Christian. He's the writer-director of the documentary film called Becoming Truly Human (2017), which looks at the religiously unaffiliated, or \"Nones,\" as a growing demographic. In this conversation we discuss his journey to Orthodox Christianity and how it intersects with his work, the problems he experienced in Western Christian theology and how the Eastern Church Fathers resolve many Christian as well as modern problems like emergence, the multiverse, cognitive science etc.\n\nCheck out Nathan\u2019s work: https://www.nathanajacobs.com\n\n========================\n\nThank you to Nicol\u00e1s Hern\u00e1ndez Moreno for creating this version of the intro music.\n\n========================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Start\n00:00:49 - Intro music\n00:01:27 - Nathan\u2019s background & story\n00:04:36 - Discovering the Church Fathers\n00:05:53 - Convergence with film\n00:07:39 - Becoming Truly Human film\n00:10:29 - The shift to long form storytelling\n00:15:10 - Fandoms\n00:16:43 - The natural search for a narrative framework\n00:24:22 - The Occult & misunderstanding mystery\n00:29:39 - The New Atheists VS materialist Christians\n00:32:06 - The \u201cNones\u201d\n00:34:41 - Enter the Church Fathers\n00:36:20 - Problems with Western Christianity\n00:47:46 - Eastern Christian fathers\n00:54:02 - Hierarchy of being\n00:58:21 - Essence/Energy distinction\n01:09:43 - The key difference between East & West\n01:13:18 - The multiverse & the inevitability of Leibniz\n01:17:28 - Outro\n\n========================\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- The Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n- Carving workshop: https://jonathanpageau.thinkific.com/courses/st-john-baptist\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",
