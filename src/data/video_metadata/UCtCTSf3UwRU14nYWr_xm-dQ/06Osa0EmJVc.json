 "description": "I sit down with Rafe Kelley on his podcast called Evolve Move Play (EMP). Rafe is interested in human movement training and parkour. Evolve Move Play \u201creconnects people to the most meaningful aspects of life and helps them cultivate their character through outdoor movement training with online courses, classes, and retreats.\u201d\n\nRafe comes from a more scientific perspective and has been in conversation with people like John Vervaeke and Paul VanderKlay (https://youtu.be/0p47jSSYXZk). This interview is an attempt to bridge the gap between the symbolic, or mythological, worldview and Rafe\u2019s more materialist presuppositions. We talk about the reemergence of the religious spirit (\u201cre-enchantment), social justice, BLM and veganism etc, the role religion has played evolutionarily, the problem of inclusion and exclusion in group identity, the work of Jonathan Haidt, spirituality, emergence and emanation, the universalist position and much more. \n\n-----------------------\n\nRelated videos:\n-Religion and Materialism - Adam Friended vs Jonathan Pageau: https://youtu.be/JLJd1-tRpiY\n-Rationality Rules - Possibilities and Limits of Metaphorical Truth: https://youtu.be/D2Sdas8_c04\n-Cognitive Science and the Sacred | with John Vervaeke: https://youtu.be/2PGglfl5j_I\n\n-----------------------\n\nFollow Rafe\u2019s work:\n-EMP Website: https://www.evolvemoveplay.com\n-YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Faelcind\n-IG: @RafeKelley - http://www.instagram.com/rafekelley/\n-FB: @RafeKelleyMovement - https://www.facebook.com/RafeKelleyMovement/\n-Twitter: @rafekelley - https://twitter.com/rafekelley\n\n-----------------------\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebsite: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\nApple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",
