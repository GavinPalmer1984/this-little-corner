 "description": "2m\u00f8rVs is a Flow-Fi music artist and has made music to cover audio clips of Jordan Peterson and myself. He recently made a whole album using one of my most pivotal talks titled Pentecost for the Zombie Apocalypse (https://youtu.be/zXOdlIXDsr8). The album is called Pentecost for the Zombie Apocalypse: The Musical. Today we take a look at a few music clips from the album and discuss his inspiration, how we both experienced the talk, Saint Christopher and what he means for the Church, Theosis, garments of skin, encountering the stranger and scientism.
