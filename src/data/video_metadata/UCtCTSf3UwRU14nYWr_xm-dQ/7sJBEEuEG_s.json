 "description": "This is our first Universal History episode on the legend of the Holy Grail. Richard Rohlin and I take a deep dive into the origin of the Holy Grail, how relics convey power and how the Grail forms an integral part of the story of the West.\n\nTo build this thread Richard explores 3 sources: the Celtic tradition and particularly their understanding of relics (pt.1), what we'll call the Iberian Virgin and her Holy Grail (pt.2), and finally the cloth that contains the face and body of Christ (pt.3).\n\nAlso, go back God's'Dog: http://www.godsdog.com\n\nBook and articles mentioned:\n- The Virgin and the Grail: Origins of a Legend by Joseph Goering: https://www.amazon.com/Virgin-Grail-Origins-Legend/dp/0300192029\n- Sacred Space, Sacred Art and The Power of Women, article by Jonathan Pageau: https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/sacred-art-and-the-power-of-women/\n\nRichard Rohlin\u2019s work:\n- Amon S\u00fbl podcast, co-hosted by Richard Rohlin: https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/amonsul\n- Finding the Golden Key book project for listeners to submit abstracts: https://findingthegoldenkey.com\n\n======================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:39 Richard\u2019s take on God\u2019s\u2019Dog\n08:02 Contents of today\u2019s discussion\n09:27 Pt.1: Relic objects in the Celtic tradition\n13:44 The altar and the fish\n18:28 The forms of the Grail\n20:40 How relics convey power\n23:56 The Stone of Anointing\n26:35 The key idea of the Holy Grail\n28:34 Pt.2: The Grail\u2019s connection to the Ascension & Pentecost\n37:10 Pt.3: The cloth containing the body of Christ\n44:14 Joseph of Arimathea\n50:24 The meaning of the unattainable Grail\n01:00:15 Outro\n\n======================\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- My brother's book on symbolism - Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\n- My intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\n- My website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",
