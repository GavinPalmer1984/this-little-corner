Jakub is Polish and has made a series of excellent videos on symbolism in anime both in English and Polish.

monsters and waters above and below, the proper relationship between center and margin, Dune, hierarchies of interpretation, Bitcoin and how to go about disobeying corrupt authority as a Christian.\n\nCheck out his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5XhtddBoZvqL16LcwMfsIw/featured\nHis Polish channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcTVpFzNQ7se83ucewXyDQw\n\nOriginal
