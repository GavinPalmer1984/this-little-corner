I look at problems of the very concept in a neutral description of reality a\nnd how the notion of Symbol can give us a better alternative to meaning.  \n\nMy links:\nSupport this channel: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nWebsite: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nThe unofficial facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nThe outro to my videos was written by Matthew Wilkinson\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/\n\nThe music at the opening is Russian Eastern Overture, by Rimsky Korsakov.",
