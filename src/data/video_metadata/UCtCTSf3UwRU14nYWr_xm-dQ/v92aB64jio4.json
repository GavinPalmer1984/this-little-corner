 "description": "This talk was given as the Spring 2018 Lecture of the St. Basil Center for Orthodox Thought and Culture at Eastern University. It was organized by Dr. Gary W. Jenkins.  \n\nThe original title of the talk was \"The Incarnation as the Principle and Center of the Enchanted World\". I deal with the traditional notion of the \"center\" and how it shows us not only why we have sacred places and sacred identities, but also how it is the basis for all perception, even underlying scientific understanding.\n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",
