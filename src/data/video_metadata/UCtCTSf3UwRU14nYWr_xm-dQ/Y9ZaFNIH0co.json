 "description": "John Vervaeke, PhD, is an award-winning lecturer at the University of Toronto in the departments of psychology, cognitive science and Buddhist psychology. This conversation between us happened in the wake of the Four Horsemen of Meaning discussion we had that also included Jordan Peterson and Bishop Barron (linked below).\n\nWe continue the discussion of meaning, trying to bridge the symbolic worldview with John Vervaeke\u2019s background in cognitive science and psychology. We discussion the way attention creates the world, the internet, the meaning of sacrifice and prophesy, transformation and synergy, collective attention and ultimately asking the question: do angels actually exist?\nEnjoy!\n\n- The 4 Horsemen of Meaning discussion with Jordan Peterson, John Vervaeke, Bishop Barron and Jonathan Pageau: https://youtu.be/FCvQsqSCWjA\n\n- John\u2019s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/johnvervaeke\n- Awakening from the Meaning Crisis playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\n- John\u2019s discussion with Jordan Peterson: A Conversation so Intense It Might as Well Be Psychedelic | John Vervaeke | The JBP Podcast | S4 E34: https://youtu.be/DLg2Q0daphE\n\n=====================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:01:23 - The Four Horsemen\n00:04:32 - The new zeitgeist\n00:09:01 - The internet as the One Ring\n00:14:01 - Attention: sacrifice and prioritization\n00:18:54 - The 2 sacrifices: ruling in & ruling out\n00:23:38 - Attention is synergistic & transformative\n00:26:50 - Attention is shared\n00:28:39 - The power of joined attention\n00:33:16 - Joined attention & our current situation\n00:35:52 - The pendulum swing of fasting\n00:38:58 - Attention culminating into personhood\n00:50:31 - The form & the vehicle\n00:53:31 - Transpersonal beings\n01:04:29 - Are transpersonal beings conscious?\n01:11:18 - Outro\n\n=====================\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- My brother's book on symbolism - Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufran\u00e7ais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",
