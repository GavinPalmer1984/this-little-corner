To exercise full autonomy and draw in listener participation, God\u2019s\u2019Dog will rely entirely on crowdfunding. We have a lot in store since this is only the first book of a whole series. In our interview Nicholas Kotar asks me about the origin of God\u2019sDog, explaining a bit about the plot, garments of skin, bridging the historical and fantastical, the return of dragons and monsters, transhumanism and entertainment in its proper perspective.\n\nBe sure to check out the God\u2019sDog website for all the tiers of support, which include add-ons like prints and signed prints
