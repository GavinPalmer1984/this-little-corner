I\u2019m very excited to have him on the channel as he\u2019s been an inspiration in the world of iconography and to me personally since I started carving icons. Today we of course talk about his work, not just in iconography but also in liturgical design more generally. We also discuss the difficulty of novelty in the modern world, the artist vs the saint, the possibilities for the sacred informing the secular, dealing with ugliness in our world and future solutions to create more beauty.
