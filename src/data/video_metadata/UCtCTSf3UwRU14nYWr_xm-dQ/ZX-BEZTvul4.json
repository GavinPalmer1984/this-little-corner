As time accelerates, it is also beginning to eliminate the natural relationships of space, of distance and reducing our capacity to exist in stable identities.  Diseases like ADHD, fragmented families and the breakdown of hierarchies in general are symptoms of a mode of being which goes with the acceleration of time. \n\nThe exact dates for my upcoming Louisiana talks.  \n\nMonday the 27th at 6:30pm - The Shape of Paradise in the Heart of Man.\nTuesday the 28th at 7pm: How funny is the end of the world?
