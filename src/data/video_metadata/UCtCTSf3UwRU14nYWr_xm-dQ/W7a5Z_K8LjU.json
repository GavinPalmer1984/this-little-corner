Jacques Derrida himself said: \"All I have done is dominated by the thought of a virus, what could be called a parasitology, a virology\". This pattern of virology butts up in an extreme way against WWII propaganda and the narrative surrounding the current pandemic. \n\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\n\nSupport
