In this video I take a look at what he seems to be trying to do with this album, looking specifically at one of his Chicago events and the song Come to Life, which includes Kim Kardashian in the music video. As you know I\u2019ve been following Kanye West for a while, keeping an eye on his effects on culture and his conversion to Christianity. I\u2019ve said before that he\u2019s playing the role of the fool who is capable of bridging extremes in culture. In his own particularities he seems to be trying to reconcile many contradictions and bringing that into the symbolism of his music as well as in his collaborations. \n\nLet us know in the comments what you think and whether you think Kanye achieved success with his album or not.\n\n================\n\n-The Symbolic World Website and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n-Merch:
