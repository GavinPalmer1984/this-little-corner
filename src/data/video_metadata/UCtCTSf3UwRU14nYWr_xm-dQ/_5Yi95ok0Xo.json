We\u2019ve been talking a lot about sacred history and how these religious patterns manifested themselves in terms of how people understood their own identities. But now we move to a more secular Western Europe, where even here there was still a desire people had to connect their own society, through memory and celebration, to different characters in the past. The Nine Worthies personify the ideals of chivalry, as established in the Middle Ages. \n\n============================\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:15 Tolkien conference\n02:58 Final notes
