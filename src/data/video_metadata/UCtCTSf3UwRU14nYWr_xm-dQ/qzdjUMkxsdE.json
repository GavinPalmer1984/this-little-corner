 "description": "One of the criticisms I get is how by saying something is symbolic, I am somehow suggesting that it is not describing an event in the world.  This stems from a deep misunderstanding of what symbolism is.  Symbolism is not so much an arbitrary allegorical representation of something, but rather the very pattern by which we notice meaning.\n\nArticle on St-Peter and St-Paul: https://www.orthodoxartsjournal.org/st-peter-on-the-right-st-paul-on-the-left/\n\nEvents Calendar:\nhttps://thesymbolicworld.com/events/\n\nMy links:\nSupport this channel: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n\npatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nsubscribestar: http://www.subscribestar.com/jonathanpageau\npaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nfacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/\n\nThe music at the opening is Russian Eastern Overture, by Rimsky Korsakov.",
