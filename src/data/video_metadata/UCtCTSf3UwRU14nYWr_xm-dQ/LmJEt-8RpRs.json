 "description": "Accelerationism, the notion that we should aggravate the current chaos in order for things to break down and bring about a better world is an idea that has been resurfacing now for some time.  We look at the issues it can bring about on a social, but also a personal scale.  \n\nMy new outro music was written and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.  \n\nSupport this channel: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n\npatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nhttps://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\npaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nfacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/\n\nThe music at the opening is Russian Eastern Overture, by Rimsky Korsakov.",
