 "description": "Expanding on a talk I gave last year called Pentecost for the Zombie Apocalypse, I discuss the meaning of the zombie and the monster in general as a portent of cultural patterns.  \n\nBy examining the traditional vision of the world and by exploring ancient stories. I trace a parallel to the development of modern art and contemporary culture through contemporary authors such as Jacques Derrida and John Vervaeke's recent book, \"Zombies in Western Culture\".   \n\nFinally I explore the positive place of the monster in the figure of St-Christopher.\n\nThis conference was given at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina on March 15th, 2017.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",
