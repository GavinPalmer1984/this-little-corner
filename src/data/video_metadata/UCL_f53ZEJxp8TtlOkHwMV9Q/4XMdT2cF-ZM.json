 "description": "A couple of days ago (Feb 12, 2019) a group calling itself the Auckland Peace Action, objecting to my slated arrival in New Zealand in a couple of days (www.jordanbpeterson.com/events/) for my 12 Rules for Life Tour, produced a \u201cpress release\u201d claiming that \u201cJordan Peterson Threatens Everything of Value in Our Society.\u201d I thought that was a bit of an overstatement and so, apparently, did journalist Sean Plunket of New Zealand\u2019s Magic Talk (http://bit.ly/2SSWHyb), who interviewed the writer/spokesperson for the Auckland Peace Action group, Iris Krzyzosiak . I think it is rather charitable to describe the results as distinctly unhelpful for the Peace Action group. \n\nIn this video compilation, I read part of the original press release, then present Sean\u2019s interview with Ms. Kryzosiak, so you can make up your own minds about the opinions of her group, and follow that with an extended interview, with an audience Q and A that I conducted with Sean a day later.\n\nHope to see you in New Zealand: See www.jordanbpeterson.com for tickets remaining in the New Zealand venues: Wellington and Auckland, as well as Australia, later: Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.   \n\nSean Plunket on Twitter: @seanplunket\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
