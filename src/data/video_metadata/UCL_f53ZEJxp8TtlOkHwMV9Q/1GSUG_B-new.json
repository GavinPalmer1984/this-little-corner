 "description": "This is a Question and Answer session that I set up for my Patreon subscribers (www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson)\n\nThanks very much to all 3500 of my Patreon supporters. As I described in this video, I plan to put the monetary support to good use. \nFirst, the Biblical series (you can find the first two, soon to be three, lectures on this youtube channel). \nSecond, a discussion series with Islamic thinkers about the relationship between Islam and the West. \nThird, my longer-term plans to make classic humanities education available world-wide. \nFourth, my work with my business partners on developing online software (like that at selfauthoring.com) to teach people how to write well -- and, at the same time (because it's the same thing), how to think. \nFifth, the development and implementation of a plan to accredit people properly for the university-level education that they will soon be able to receive online.\n\nThat's a good start. Thanks to all of you for increasing its probability, and for the support, psychological, practical and monetary.\n\nOver and out.\n\nBible Series Season Ticket: https://transactions.sendowl.com/prod...\nBible Series Information and Tickets: http://jordanbpeterson.com/bible-series\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
