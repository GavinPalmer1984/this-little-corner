 "description": "In the second week of January (2019) I spoke with Dr. Peter Boghossian, Dr. James Lindsay, and Helen Pluckrose, authors of the infamous \u201cGrievance studies\u201d hoax papers. We discussed their motivations and the consequences of their actions. \n\nPortland State University is currently taking disciplinary actions against Dr. Boghossian, having found him guilty of academic misconduct for failing to have PSU\u2019s Institutional Review Board approve his \"studies\" before they were conducted (!) \n\nDraw your own conclusions...\n\nGoogle Drive containing all the papers and reviewer comments: http://bit.ly/2OsWnnH\n\nMike Nayna's ongoing YouTube series documenting the Grievance Studies Affair: https://bit.ly/2TBnICS\n\nAn account of the disciplinary proceedings against Dr Boghossian: https://bit.ly/2GWEISL\n\nA number of influential scholars have written letters of support for Dr. Boghossian.
