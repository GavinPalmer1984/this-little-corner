He\u2019s worked in genres as diverse as pop, hip-hop, indie, dance, and more recently, perhaps, something that has come to be known as Lofi. \n\nFor reasons that have been quite surprising to me, Akira has been making lowfi tracks, also known as meaningwave, a combination of metred spoken word and music chosen for its emotional and conceptual appropriateness,  from some of my saying and my talks. They been reasonably well-listened to (although I am not sure of the standards of such things), garnering maybe a million views over the 10 or 15 or so that he has posted. The two main albums, 12 Rules for Life and JBP Wave Genesis, have elicited more than million streams each on Spotify (and that doesn\u2019t include iTunes and other content providers of the same type). \n\nThe third album oriented around my words is entitled JBP Wave: Paradise. It was released in April of 2019. Earlier that month, Akira also released a long single, 42 Rules for Life, based on the totality of the rules I had written for Quora several years ago.  \n\nAkira has also produced similar works featuring Alan Watts, Jocko Willink (who is currently number one in the meaningwave tracks), Terrence McKenna, David Foster Wallace and Elon Musk, among others. Overall, Spotify downloads have topped 4 million, with an approximate exposure of a million. \n\nAkira the Don can be found on YouTube at http://bit.ly/2VVHOMX\n\nHere's the streaming/download links - click them to choose your preferred service:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/42rulesforlife\nhttps://fanlink.to/jbpwaveparadise\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 6833, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "I carry the dawn is a British musician DJ and producer", "start": 1.81, "duration": 3.45}, {"text": "He's worked in genres as diverse as pop hip hop in the dance and more recently", "start": 6.11, "duration": 6.139}, {"text": "Perhaps something that has come to be known as lo-fi", "start": 12.25, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "for reasons that have been quite surprising to me acara has been making lo-fi tracks also known as meaning waves a", "start": 15.32, "duration": 7.16}, {"text": "Combination of metered spoken word and music chosen for its emotional and conceptual appropriateness from some of my sayings and my talks", "start": 22.94, "duration": 7.49}, {"text": "They have been reasonably well listened to garnering maybe a million views over the 10 or 15 or so that he has posted on YouTube", "start": 30.92, "duration": 7.61}, {"text": "the two main albums", "start": 38.78, "duration": 1.95}, {"text": "12 rules for life and jbp Wave Genesis have elicited more than a million streams each on Spotify", "start": 40.73, "duration": 6.829}, {"text": "And that doesn't include iTunes and other content providers of the same type", "start": 47.75, "duration": 4.099}, {"text": "The third album oriented around my words will be entitled jbp Wave", "start": 52.399, "duration": 4.82}, {"text": "paradise", "start": 57.83, "duration": 1.05}, {"text": "It will be released a week today", "start": 58.88, "duration": 2.03}, {"text": "Earlier this week Akira also released a long single", "start": 61.85, "duration": 3.11}, {"text": "42 rules for life based on the totality of the rules.
