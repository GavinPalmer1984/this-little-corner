 "description": "A number of people in recent months suggested that I speak with Charlie Kirk, a young man who heads Turning Point USA (https://www.tpusa.com/), an organization whose mission is, in its own words, to \" educate students about the importance of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government.\" Turning Point has a presence on more than 1000 campus, and appears to be growing quickly. It seems to me to be a reaction to the overwhelming dominance of radical left ideology in such arenas. We discussed his views, recent activity, and future plans. \n\nAdditional relevant links:\n\nMy new book: 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMy first book: Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\nDr Jordan B Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\n\nSelf Authoring Suite: http://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: http://understandmyself.com/\n\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/10/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
