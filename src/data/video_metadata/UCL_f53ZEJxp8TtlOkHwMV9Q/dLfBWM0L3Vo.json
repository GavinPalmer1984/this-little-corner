This is an interview from New Zealand from a couple of months ago. I think it's still relevant. I hope it's still relevant. \n\nThe interviewer, Sean Plunkett, is one of New Zealand's more credible journalists, in my estimation. He's received the Qantas Media Awards in radio and television categories, the New Zealand Radio Awards and the 2001 European Union Journalist Award.\n\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 2567, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "all right great I think I've almost got", "start": 0.03, "duration": 4.229}, {"text": "you all your first let's get the", "start": 3.179, "duration": 2.941}, {"text": "pronouns out of the way what would you", "start": 4.259, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "prefer I told you professor dr.
