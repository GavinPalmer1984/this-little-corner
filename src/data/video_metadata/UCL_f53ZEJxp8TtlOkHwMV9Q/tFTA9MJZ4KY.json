Bari Weiss is a journalist and author. She has worked as an opinion writer and editor at the New York Times, before that she was an OP editor and book reviewer at the Wallstreet Journal and a senior editor at tablet magazine. Bari now writes for herself on SubStack.\n\nJordan and Bari Weiss discussed her career, the circumstances surrounding her resignation from the New York Times, the aftermath of her famous resignation letter which criticized the New York Times, Twitter and social media, the phrase \u201cSystemic Racism\u201d, the work she is doing now, and much more.\nFind more Bari Weiss on her substack Common Sense with Bari Weiss https://bariweiss.substack.com/, on Twitter @bariweiss, and read her notorious resignation letter at https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\n[00:00] Intro\n[0:18] Jordan introduces this episode\u2019s guest journalist and writer Bari Weiss\n[2:00] Starting off with Bari's journey leading up to working for the New York Times. The original goal of her position at the Times was to provide a unique perspective through opinion pieces that wouldn't normally be on the radar of a typical Times reader or writer\n[6:00] Weiss writing career starting with the Wallstreet Journal before moving onto the Times\n[8:00] Jordan does a small divergence into the undergraduate experience in modern elite universities, specifically in the humanities. Bari speaks on her experience with politically directed curriculum\n[22:30] Weiss connects the experience of modern universities as her first exposure to an ideal of neo-racism that would cause her future actions as a journalist\n[30:30] A closer examination of the phrase \"Systemic Racism\" and what it typically implies for those that use it in western culture\n[44:30] Weiss talks about the beginning of her experience writing and editing at the Times. She was always the odd one out with her opinions and faced \n[55:30] Examining the attractive attributes of accepting the system of ideas associated with new systemic racism ideology. The thin veneer of society and the illogical drive to tear down what seems to be bringing the most benefit of any time in history to the poor and disadvantaged\n[1:10:00] Jordan critiques the flaw with the new atheist\u2019s destruction of religion. People need something in their lives that is some sort of romantic adventure in their eyes\n[1:15:30] Going back to the Times. What type of journalist/editor was Weiss trying to be?\n[1:24:00] The danger of keeping quiet instead of speaking up when it's absolutely paramount to do so\n[1:34:30] What was the final turn of events that led Bari to see the Time as a place she could no longer work in good faith?\n[1:40:00] Jordan asks Weiss to comment on the generational divide he sees, should a corporation be a moral actor?\n[1:44:00] The fallout from the Tom Cotton article on bringing in the national guard during riots in 2020\n[1:51:00] The temptation of writing \"heroin\" for your readers or listeners. The cost of telling the truth and the increased cost for young unestablished people is concerning\n[2:05:00] Establishing the idea of Judgement as a necessity. How do you foster the next generation to think critically and become a good mentor instead of a tyrant to a younger mentee?\n[2:14:00] Jordan asks Bari what her plans are for the future with substack and writing/editing\n[2:21:30] Wrapping up the show.
