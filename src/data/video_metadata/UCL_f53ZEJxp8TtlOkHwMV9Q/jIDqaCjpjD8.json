We're all horrified by these things - yet they always seem to be with us. The human thirst for atrocity is at the heart of what psychologist Jordan Peterson has to say, in a talk he gave at the Stratford Festival, and in conversation with Paul Kennedy. Part of the answer lies in John Milton's great poem, Paradise Lost. It turns out Milton had a lot to say about our appetite for violence 350 years ago.\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/a-history-of-violence-1.2994267 \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support:
