Abraham's life is presented as a series of encapsulated narratives, punctuated by sacrifice, and the rekindling of his covenant with God. This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revaluation and reconsideration of identity, prior to the next step forward. Abraham, for his part, makes the sacrifices necessary to continue to walk with God, or before God (as the terminology in this section has it). It is this decision that allows him to transcend the vicissitudes of life, and to take his role as the father of nations. \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.
