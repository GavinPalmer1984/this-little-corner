Dr. Anthony Daniels is a British writer and essayist. He is known for writing such pieces as Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass, The Mandarins and the Masses, Not With a Bang With A Whimper, Spoiled rotten: The toxic cult of sentimentality, and The Terror of Existence. His columns in the Times, Spectator, and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nDr. Anthony Daniels and Jordan discussed a variety of topics relating to distinct differences in culture and mindset in the poor \u201cUnderclass\u201d in Britain. They examine many stories from Dr. Daniel's time as a consulting physician in a prison and hospital in one of the poorest areas of London and draw conclusions on similarities in violence, domestic abuse, learned helplessness, education, monogamy, the disintegration of the family, and more.\n\nFind more Dr. Anthony Daniels writing under his pen name Theodore Dalrymple \nThe Jordan B.
