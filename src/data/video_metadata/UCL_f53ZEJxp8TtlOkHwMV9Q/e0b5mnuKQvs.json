 "description": "Support this channel at https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3019121\n\nHere's a paper I wrote a few years ago that discusses how to operate in the spaces between categories: It's called Peacemaking Among Higher Order Primates -- a tongue in cheek title: http://bit.ly/2gEPwGD\n\nJonathan Pageau is a Quebecois artist, a carver of Russian Orthodox icons, and a sculptor. He's touched with more than a bit of genius, and has deep knowledge of archetype and symbolism. In this video, which is Part I of II, we discuss art, tradition, and the strange and unsettling things that exist between categories.\n\nJonathan Pageau's work can be seen here: http://www.pageaucarvings.com/index.html \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
