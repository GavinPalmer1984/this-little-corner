We talked about Deepak Chopra; the place of consciousness in the world; the neuroscience, evolutionary biology and metaphysics of Heaven and Hell; the pros and cons of ideas about the afterlife; the idea of \u201cup\u201d as the moral aim and the potential basis for that metaphor in the reality of the social hierarchy; the Kingdom of God as a psychological reality; the reality of transcendent experience; psychedelic experience; the definition of truth; Nietzsche\u2019s critique of Christianity; transhumanism, the singularity, life extension and the prolongation of youth; the danger of losing our humanity in technological revolution; the malleability of identity; bodily and spiritual resurrection; the nature of the persistent and transforming self; Michael\u2019s personal transformation from areligious to evangelical to skeptic; Sam Harris; the division of the damned from the saved (or the wheat from the chaff); Ayn Rand; Jocko Willink and the utility of striving; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; the truth of fiction; postmodernism and interpretation; dragons, archetypes and intrinsic brain structure; Martin Gardner; responsibility; social ethics; the nature of belief; the collapse of free will into determinism as the future shades into the present; moral accountability and the law; the aim of his new book (Heavens on Earth); a meaningful life and working to make the world a better place\u2026 and that\u2019s about that. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:
