Dr. Marc Mercer, President of SAF, and professor in the Department of Philosophy of Halifax's St. Mary's University introduced me. \n\nI would like to thank SAF for their support over the last year.\n\nThis talk focuses on the reasons that the right to free speech must be considered in some sense paramount among the intrinsic rights, rather than merely one value among many. There is no difference between free speech and free thought, for starters, and without free thought it is impossible to know oneself or the world. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 6352, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "Jordan Peterson psychology professor at", "start": 0.0, "duration": 4.17}, {"text": "the State University of Western Ontario", "start": 2.129, "duration": 5.67}, {"text": "but no University of Toronto been there", "start": 4.17, "duration": 7.759}, {"text": "some years fast got involved because we", "start": 7.799, "duration": 9.301}, {"text": "we were sent the letters that dr.", "start": 11.929, "duration": 10.991}, {"text": "Peterson's Dean and then vice provost", "start": 17.1, "duration": 8.429}, {"text": "him and they worried us so tremendously", "start": 22.92, "duration": 4.71}, {"text": "as people concerned about academic", "start": 25.529, "duration": 5.42}, {"text": "freedom and the integrity of teaching", "start": 27.63, "duration": 8.46}, {"text": "the the letters warned dr.
