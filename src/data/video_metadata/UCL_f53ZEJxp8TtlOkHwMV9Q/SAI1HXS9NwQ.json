 "description": "To watch the full episode: https://youtu.be/ISHmPXOS_Og @Mikhaila Peterson \n\nIf you want to improve yourself, you might look to someone you admire and imitate them. You'll pull yourself towards them by the process of imitation.\n\nYou might think comparing yourself to someone is different than imitating, but imitating and comparing are the same thing. When you compare yourself to someone, you start pulling yourself towards them. You have to be careful you don't get envious or resentful. In some sense, by continually imitating somebody at a higher level, you're always unfulfilled. In another sense, that means you're always growing. \n\nJung believed the book of Revelations had been tacked onto the New Testament because the Christ in the gospels was portrayed too much as a figure of mercy. Whereas, in Revelations, Christ is portrayed primarily as a judge. Jung\u2019s explanation was that every ideal is a judge. The ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge. The ultimate ideal judges your soul. The higher the ideal, the more severe the judge. That should make you quake. When your conscience assaults you in the middle of the night for things you\u2019ve done wrong, it\u2019s because you\u2019re quaking in your boots, morally, because you\u2019ve failed to live up to this ideal.\n\nPlease do not forget to subscribe to the channel in order to enjoy weekly videos.
