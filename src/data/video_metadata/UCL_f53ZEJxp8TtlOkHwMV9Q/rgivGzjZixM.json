 "description": "Tomorrow, I will be debating the renowned Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek (https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/) at the Sony Centre in Toronto at 7:30 PM on the topic: Happiness: Capitalism vs Marxism. We have decided to livestream this event, for those who might be interested in watching events unfold as they happen. Tickets for the livestream are available at https://www.jordanvsslavojdebate.com/ and also enable the debate to be viewed any time up to 30 days after purchase.  We will also place the debate, in its entirety, on YouTube after a month. \n\nI\u2019d also like to let you know that Season 2 of the Jordan B Peterson Podcast has now started, with the first three episodes up: two 12 Rules for Life lectures, one from Seattle and one from Portland, as well as an interview with General Stanley McChrystal, retired four star general and former commander of the International Security Assistance Force and Commander, US Forces, Afghanistan. We have partnered with Westwood One (https://www.westwoodone.com), the largest audio network in the US. My daughter Mikhaila (https://mikhailapeterson.com/) is serving as co-host. This means, we hope, higher production quality, weekly delivery, and a broader reach for the podcast, which will now also be ad-supported. Jordan Peterson Videos on YouTube, which will also feature most of the podcast content, will remain unmonetized, as previously.\n\nI am going to London in May to celebrate and promote the release of the May 2 standard Penguin paperback of 12 Rules for Life into the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Indian and other international English markets (not including the US and Canada as of yet). Pre-orders of that paperback can be obtained at the Penguin website here: http://bit.ly/2ItAuRH  I\u2019m very excited to join the great back catalog of Penguin paperbacks, which I have always loved. I\u2019m also attending an academic conference on free speech at Oxford while in England, and subjecting myself with some trepidation to the UK press. \n\nFinally, I wanted to tell you about https://www.selfauthoring.com/ and https://www.understandmyself.com/ The first is a series of writing programs that helps people understand their past, present and future selves. The second is a personality test based on the Big Five (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, as well as the ten aspects that provide that test with higher-resolution results). We are offering a 20% discount on both the 2 for 1 sale at selfauthoring and understandmyself.\n\nDiscount Code: MAY \n\nfor selfauthoring, enter code here: https://www.selfauthoring.com/IasIntegration/Purchase/Setup/58\n\nfor understandmyself, enter code here:\n\nhttps://www.understandmyself.com/IasIntegration/Purchase/Setup/17\n\nI might also mention, finally (a lot of news this week) that I was in New York on Monday, taping 16 interviews with Dr. Oz on every topic under the sun related to my work. Some of those will be aired directly on his network show. The others will be released soon on YouTube and other social media. \n\nSo that\u2019s it. \n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
