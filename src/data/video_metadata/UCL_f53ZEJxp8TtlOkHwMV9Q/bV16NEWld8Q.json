Jung had this idea that people's shadows reach all the way down to hell", "start": 70.64, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "which is actually a very frightening concept, and what he meant by that is", "start": 78.16, "duration": 4.42}, {"text": "if you take a look at the impulses that drive you that are actually malevolent, if you can admit to such impulses", "start": 82.58, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "that if you basically follow those all the way down to their origin, you can find some very nasty things", "start": 89.3, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "and what you find down there basically is what allies you with people who've done terrible things", "start": 96.7, "duration": 5.54}, {"text": "and that's not a very pleasant experience, I would say", "start": 102.24, "duration": 6.3}, {"text": "although one thing that's worth thinking about is that it is something that can protect you against being very very badly hurt", "start": 108.54, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "because one of the things that characterizes people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder", "start": 117.18, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "is that they're often naive, and then they encounter something that's really not within their framework of thinking", "start": 123.42, "duration": 6.22}, {"text": "and it's usually something bad, and because there isn't anything in their philosophy, their way of looking at the world", "start": 129.64, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "that has prepared them for that, they end up fragmented and devastated", "start": 135.96, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "it's actually protective to you if you can figure out what your full range of capabilities is", "start": 140.56, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "because that can help you understand other people a lot better, and to be wiser and more careful in your actions", "start": 148.56, "duration": 8.36}, {"text": "it's also useful, I think, if you want to convince yourself to act properly", "start": 156.92, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "because if you regard yourself as harmless, which is a big mistake, then nothing you can do is really that bad", "start": 162.12, "duration": 9.02}, {"text": "right? because you're harmless, after all; but if you understand that you're seriously not harmless", "start": 171.14, "duration": 5.06}, {"text": "then that can make you a lot more careful with yourself", "start": 176.2, "duration": 4.18}, {"text": "and I would say that's especially true maybe when you're dealing... when you have kids, and you start dealing with your kids", "start": 180.38, "duration": 5.62}, {"text": "if you know that... what you're capable of, because you're human", "start": 186.0, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "then that can motivate you to be much more careful with what you say and do", "start": 190.16, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "and I don't mean cautious, I don't mean timid, I don't mean any of that", "start": 195.6, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "I just mean that you wanna keep things pristine between you and your children, let's say", "start": 200.06, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "because that way they're on your good side, and you want them on your good side", "start": 204.54, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "because children who get on their parents' bad side suffer very badly for it, and sometimes it's because they're literally abused", "start": 209.06, "duration": 7.78}, {"text": "but more often it's because they get, well they get abused, let's say, or neglected, in  much more subtle ways", "start": 216.84, "duration": 7.36}, {"text": "and you're definitely capable of that, I mean, all you have to do is think about the way you've interacted", "start": 224.2, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "with someone that you've decided to not like, or maybe someone you genuinely don't like", "start": 230.52, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "and that can range from just not paying any attention to them, especially if they're doing something good", "start": 235.12, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "to really pursuing them, and making their life miserable, and you can certainly do that with your family members", "start": 239.72, "duration": 5.62}, {"text": "and you can do that with your intimate partners, and you can do that with your friends, and you can do it with yourself", "start": 245.34, "duration": 4.82}, {"text": "so it's really worth knowing that, so... well...", "start": 250.16, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "the Fox thinks he's a royal rule breaker, but he's really just a two-bit thug, and this is where he learns that", "start": 256.0, "duration": 7.22}, {"text": "so... sorry, I have a new phone, and I'm kind of stupid with it, still", "start": 263.22, "duration": 6.3}, {"text": "so...", "start": 269.52, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "well, hypothetically that would work, probably won't", "start": 275.2, "duration": 4.9}, {"text": "anyways, the Coachman's got these guys in his grasp now, regardless", "start": 280.1, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "partly because they're already down this road, and they can't back off, and partly 'cause he also offers them more money than they've seen before", "start": 285.94, "duration": 6.74}, {"text": "so as bad as they are, they're going to get worse... many of you, I presume, have seen Breaking Bad", "start": 292.68, "duration": 6.5}, {"text": "that's a really good example of the incorporation, at least in part, or maybe the possession by the shadow from a Jungian perspective", "start": 299.18, "duration": 9.0}, {"text": "right, because you have this ordinary high school teacher who really thinks that he's an axe [?] and his family as well", "start": 308.18, "duration": 6.26}, {"text": "you know, like your typical persona, roughly speaking, he's just a normal guy", "start": 314.44, "duration": 4.94}, {"text": "but part of the reason that he's a normal guy is 'cause he actually hasn't been put in abnormal circumstances", "start": 319.38, "duration": 5.56}, {"text": "and then all of a sudden he is, and he has a genuine moral conundrum, right, he's gonna die of lung cancer", "start": 324.94, "duration": 4.82}, {"text": "and he has a son who's got a lot of health problems", "start": 329.76, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "and he's terrified that he's going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing", "start": 334.0, "duration": 5.14}, {"text": "and then of course as the story... and so he decides to do something that... temporarily... that he regards as... that he would normally regard as reprehensible", "start": 339.14, "duration": 9.66}, {"text": "and of course he just gets tangled up in that, but then, as the story unfolds, you see that there's... it's more complicated", "start": 348.8, "duration": 5.46}, {"text": "because it's not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad, he's also very resentful", "start": 354.26, "duration": 6.14}, {"text": "and angry, and it's partly because he's a bit of a pushover at the beginning, or maybe more than a bit of a pushover", "start": 360.4, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "and also that he didn't really fulfill his own potential, and that, you know", "start": 365.56, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "he had friends who walked down the entrepreneurial path and maybe they weren't quite fair to him, but whatever", "start": 370.08, "duration": 8.14}, {"text": "he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher, so he's really angry about that, and so", "start": 378.22, "duration": 5.38}, {"text": "there's more motivation for him opening up the door to the terrible elements of his personality", "start": 383.6, "duration": 6.28}, {"text": "than just the fact that he's got good motivations to do so", "start": 389.88, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "and that unfolds, so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character", "start": 393.88, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to, really, total brutality, and it's quite good", "start": 399.76, "duration": 7.96}, {"text": "there's a book called \"Ordinary Men\" that's a lot like that", "start": 407.72, "duration": 4.18}, {"text": "I don't think I've mentioned that to you before, but \"Ordinary Men\" is a book about... it's the best book of its type", "start": 411.9, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "maybe it's the only book of its type... it's possible, but it's plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense", "start": 416.78, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "it's a story about these German policemen in the early stages of World War II", "start": 423.74, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "and they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the Hitlerian propaganda came out in full force", "start": 429.62, "duration": 8.28}, {"text": "if you were a teenager, say, in the 1930s, you were gonna be pulled right into the propaganda machine", "start": 437.9, "duration": 4.3}, {"text": "and maybe you were part of the Hitler Youth, like you were raised in that, you know", "start": 442.2, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "but if you were older, then you were raised before that", "start": 445.92, "duration": 3.0}, {"text": "and you're not as amenable to propaganda once you're older than about, well, I would say, about 22 or  something like that", "start": 448.92, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "it's pretty young, actually; if you're gonna make a soldier, you have to get a soldier young", "start": 455.88, "duration": 4.68}, {"text": "'cause once people are in their early twenties, say, they already have their personality developed", "start": 460.56, "duration": 5.74}, {"text": "anyways, these policemen were sent into Poland after the Germans marched through", "start": 466.3, "duration": 6.42}, {"text": "and, you know, it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that", "start": 472.72, "duration": 5.8}, {"text": "the Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column in undermining the German war effort", "start": 478.52, "duration": 5.0}, {"text": "because of course the Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually  setting up the conditions that made the war necessary", "start": 483.52, "duration": 7.02}, {"text": "and the police were sent into Poland, they were also required to make peace, roughly speaking", "start": 490.54, "duration": 6.6}, {"text": "they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65", "start": 497.14, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "and gathering them in stadiums, and then shipping them off on trains, but that isn't where they ended", "start": 503.2, "duration": 5.62}, {"text": "they ended in a very, very dark place, I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women", "start": 508.82, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training", "start": 515.3, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "and what's really interesting about that is that their commander told them that they could go home at any time", "start": 518.68, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "so this is not one of those examples of people following orders", "start": 525.76, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "and the reason they didn't, roughly speaking, there's many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn't", "start": 530.52, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "is because they didn't think it was comradely, so to speak, to leave the guys they were working with", "start": 535.86, "duration": 6.2}, {"text": "to do all the dirty work and run off; and that's a really interesting fact", "start": 542.06, "duration": 5.26}, {"text": "because in different circumstances you wouldn't think about that as reprehensible", "start": 547.32, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "you'd think: well, that's part of team work under rough circumstances; and that's at least in part how they viewed it", "start": 552.34, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "they were also made physically ill multiple times, physically and psychologically ill, by the thing that they had to do", "start": 559.3, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "but they kept doing them anyways, so one step at a time", "start": 565.3, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "and that's the thing, is that you end up in very bad place one step at a time, so you better watch those steps", "start": 569.9, "duration": 5.74}, {"text": "anyways, Pinokio has now decided, after his latest misadventure, to return to the proper pathway", "start": 575.64, "duration": 10.1}, {"text": "he's off to school again, and he's still pretty naive, although perhaps not as much so as he was before", "start": 585.74, "duration": 6.68}, {"text": "so he decided that he's gonna do things right, he's gonna go get educated, he's going back to school", "start": 592.42, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "he's gonna take the conventional route to discipline, and be a good boy, roughly speaking", "start": 596.74, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "and so, he's off to school, and the fox waylays him again", "start": 601.48, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "this is a really interesting scene, took me quite a long time to unpack this too", "start": 606.52, "duration": 6.26}, {"text": "and so, the fox, first of all, starts out by acting like he's sympathetic again, sympathetic towards Pinocchio", "start": 612.78, "duration": 7.48}, {"text": "and so, he's empathetic, you could say, and... so this is an interesting analysis of empathy", "start": 620.26, "duration": 6.62}, {"text": "so what happens is the fox convinces Pinokio through a variety of maneuvers", "start": 626.88, "duration": 6.54}, {"text": "that he's actually not feeling very well, that he's sick, he really convinces him that he's a victim", "start": 633.42, "duration": 4.94}, {"text": "and one of the things... I had a graduate student named Maya Maja Djikic, who had worked with the UN in  Bosnia", "start": 638.36, "duration": 8.96}, {"text": "and she had toured some of the mass grave sites there, and we wrote a paper one time, called:", "start": 647.32, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "\"You can neither remember nor forget what you don't understand\"", "start": 652.34, "duration": 4.18}, {"text": "and it was a paper about the idea, for example, it was partly about the idea that we should never forget the Holocaust", "start": 656.52, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "and that the idea there is that, well, we should never forget it and we should never repeat it", "start": 663.6, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "but the thing is, if you don't understand how those things come about, you can't really remember them, right?", "start": 667.52, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "you think about them as a set of historical facts, but that's not the kind of remembering that actually makes any difference", "start": 672.28, "duration": 6.86}, {"text": "you have to understand the causal pathways, you have to understand how a society would transform in that manner", "start": 679.14, "duration": 5.74}, {"text": "and more importantly, you have to understand the role of the individuals within that society", "start": 684.88, "duration": 5.32}, {"text": "unless you're going to assume that they're so completely unlike you that there's no connection whatsoever", "start": 690.2, "duration": 5.24}, {"text": "in which case you haven't remembered it at all, you haven't learned anything at all", "start": 695.44, "duration": 4.34}, {"text": "because the right lesson from what happened in the 20th century is: this is what human beings are like", "start": 699.78, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "that's the correct lesson, and you can say: well, not me; but...", "start": 705.12, "duration": 5.46}, {"text": "but probably you too, that's the thing, probably", "start": 710.58, "duration": 7.26}, {"text": "and probably me too, and least under normal circumstances; anyways...", "start": 717.84, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "the Fox convinces Pinocchio that he's sick, he performs a lot of tricks to do this", "start": 722.08, "duration": 8.5}, {"text": "now, you could say that Pinocchio is susceptible to this", "start": 730.58, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "because maybe there's still a part of him that's looking for the easy way out, and so...", "start": 735.6, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "one of the things that Maja and I found when we were writing this paper", "start": 739.98, "duration": 3.9}, {"text": "we were looking at the discourse that precedes genocide and genocidal states", "start": 743.88, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "and the enhancement of a sense of victimization on the part of one of the groups", "start": 748.04, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "usually the group that's going to commit the genocide", "start": 752.76, "duration": 2.56}, {"text": "first of all, their sense of being victims is much heightened by the demagogues", "start": 755.32, "duration": 5.94}, {"text": "who are trying to stir up this sort of hatred, so they basically say: look, you've been oppressed in a variety of ways", "start": 761.26, "duration": 5.24}, {"text": "and these are the people who did it, and they're not gonna stop doing it, and this time we're gonna get them before they get us", "start": 766.5, "duration": 4.94}, {"text": "it's something like that; and so there's something very pathological about the enhancement of victimization", "start": 771.44, "duration": 6.78}, {"text": "which is, well... see the problem as far as I'm concerned with it is, it's not thought through very well", "start": 778.22, "duration": 13.98}, {"text": "because there's a point that's being made, and the point is that people have been oppressed and they suffer", "start": 792.2, "duration": 8.24}, {"text": "and that's true, that point; but then the proper framework from within which to interpret that", "start": 800.44, "duration": 10.6}, {"text": "I believe is that that's characteristic of life, you can't take it personally in some sense", "start": 811.04, "duration": 7.7}, {"text": "and you can't divide the world neatly into perpetrators and victims", "start": 818.74, "duration": 3.9}, {"text": "and you certainly can't divide the whole world neatly into perpetrators and victims and then assume that you're only in the victim class", "start": 822.64, "duration": 5.58}, {"text": "and then assume that that gives you certain... like access to certain... forms of redress, let's say", "start": 828.22, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "it gets dangerous very rapidly if you do that sort of thing, so...
