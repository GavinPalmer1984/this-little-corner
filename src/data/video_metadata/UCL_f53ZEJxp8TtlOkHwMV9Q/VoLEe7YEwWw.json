 "description": "I'm going to 30+ cities to talk about the issues raised in my books, both new (12 Rules for Life: https://bit.ly/2DSnDn1) and older (Maps of Meaning (1999): https://bit.ly/2pR7uJj), or to discuss psychology, religion and the state of the world with Matt Dillahunty, Sam Harris and Douglas Murray. It's all part of sorting things out :)\n\nDave Rubin of The Rubin Report (https://www.youtube.com/Rubinreport) is going to open about a dozen of these venues. \n\nAll this is crazily good, as far as I'm concerned. I've had tens of thousands of letters from people over the last year, saying either \"watching your lectures has helped me find words to express things I already knew, but didn't know I knew\" or \"I was in a dark, nihilistic, addicted, depressed, vengeful place and I've been trying to develop a vision for my life and tell the truth (or at least ceased lying) and things are much better.\"\n\nHow good is that? And what would happened if hundreds of thousands of people put themselves together? This is what would happen: The future would be better, instead of worse. That seems worth doing, particularly given the alternative.\n\nDates, Cities and Tickets\n\nFri April 13, Toronto (with Matt Dillahunty): https://bit.ly/2GmNNzo\nThurs May 3, Toronto (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2pQXShY\nFri May 4, Washington (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2GGSA20\nSat May 5, Chicago (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2GDR1lp\nSun May 6, Detroit (with Dave Rubin): https://livemu.sc/2GGv8lm\nTues May 8, Denver (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2GGPXtB\nWed May 9, San Francisco (with Dave Rubin): https://livemu.sc/2E8fzh2\nThurs May 10, Seattle (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2GJKhme\nSun May 13, London UK (with Dave Rubin): http://bit.ly/2oldTM2\nMon May 21, Toronto: https://bit.ly/2E5B7eo\nTuesday May 22, Boston: https://bit.ly/2GmxBhv\nWed May 23, Philadelphia: https://bit.ly/2J8iryc\nTues May 29, Houston: https://bit.ly/2pRmTsz\nWed May 30, Dallas (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2pTzDzu\nThursday May 31, Austin (with Dave Rubin): http://ticketf.ly/2olK6mA\nFri June 01, Phoenix (with Dave Rubin): https://bit.ly/2GXBZop\nTues June 04, Reykjav\u00edk: https://bit.ly/2IjibeB\nFri June 08, Washington: https://bit.ly/2GXe1tk \nSat June 09, Richmond: https://bit.ly/2GoYNfI\nSun June 10, Charlotte: https://bit.ly/2J4Linj\nMon June 11, Nashville: https://bit.ly/2pWTrl0\nTues June 12, Atlanta: https://bit.ly/2E7Zwjr\nThurs June 14, Louisville: https://bit.ly/2pR1D5W\nFri June 15, Indianapolis: https://bit.ly/2pV6K59\nSat June 16, Milwaukee: https://bit.ly/2GpNHan\nSun June 17, Minneapolis: https://bit.ly/2GXPPqX\nThurs June 21, Seattle: https://bit.ly/2J7HBgG\nSat June 23, Vancouver (with Sam Harris): https://bit.ly/2GJsLOM\nSun June 24, Vancouver (with Sam Harris): https://bit.ly/2uyjYKP\nMon June 25, Portland: https://bit.ly/2Gn0Dh4\nWed June 27, Sacramento: https://bit.ly/2pRSRWl\nThurs June 28, San Diego: https://bit.ly/2pRwwrM\nFri June 29, Long Beach: https://bit.ly/2uGJTAf\nSat June 30, Thousand Oaks: https://bit.ly/2pPh2DY\nSat July 14, Dublin (with Sam Harris/Douglas Murray): https://bit.ly/2pU8go9\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
