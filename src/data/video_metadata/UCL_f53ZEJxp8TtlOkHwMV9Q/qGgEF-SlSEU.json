In this case, @Nicole Arbour posted clips, and we posted the whole interview, aiming to offer both our audiences something entertaining and, hopefully, compelling. Nicole and I discuss role models, casual contempt, sales and marketing, social media, Harry Potter books and films, gender dysphoria, dating advice for women with high IQ\u2019s, and more.\n\nNicole Arbour is a Canadian (now American) comedian, choreographer, singer, and YouTuber. She is known for her work in acting on television and film and more recently as a comedian and entertainer through the most popular social media channels.\n\nFind more of Nicole Arbour on Twitter
