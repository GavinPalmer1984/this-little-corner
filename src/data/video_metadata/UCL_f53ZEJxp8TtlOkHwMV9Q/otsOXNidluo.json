Then I'm off to Europe with Tammy, my wife, and Dave Rubin until mid-November to to continue the 12 Rules for Life Tour. Tickets are still available for the UK venues: www.jordanbpeterson/events\n\nLewis Howes (www.lewishowes.com) interviewed me in July 2018. He put up the discussion in two parts (Part 1: https://bit.ly/2BNk0SN; Part 2: https://bit.ly/2yI0QbW). People seem pleased with the discussion. I talked to Lewis and we decided that reposting it here might bring it to the attention of more people. The episodes here have been combined into one post.\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:
