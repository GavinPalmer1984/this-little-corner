 "description": "I spoke at a Heritage Foundation event in New York City in April 2019. Genevieve Wood and I discussed reasons for the apparently increasing attractiveness of socialist ideas in America and the (countervailing) importance and meaningful of personal responsibility, as well as considering why communicating that import appears to be appealing to such a large number of people. \n\nYou can also listen to the interview on The Heritage Events Podcast (http://bit.ly/2UQokcM).  And, you can read what Heritage president Kay Coles James has to say to the younger generation about socialism here: https://herit.ag/2GxxbXc\n\nThe full program, which includes an address by the Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James is available here at the Heritage Foundation YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2VhTvNF (as is the lecture that I am posting here, on my channel, now). \n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
