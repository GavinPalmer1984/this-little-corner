Those characters are archetypal -- hyper-real, in a sense. Archetypal characters have archetypal adventures. The prime adventure (excluding romance) is the initiatory voyage. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:

enable you to understand", "start": 18.06, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "I think it will enable you to understand stories", "start": 21.18, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "Like the one I told you last time, you remember Jonah and the whale", "start": 24.22, "duration": 2.56}, {"text": "I want to provide you with the schema so you can understand stories like that", "start": 28.14, "duration": 5.6},

archetypes", "start": 39.1, "duration": 1.92}, {"text": "And an archetype, it is an idea that was made most popular over the last 100 years by Carl Jung", "start": 41.9, "duration": 8.54}, {"text": "But it's a much older idea than that", "start": 50.78, "duration": 1.24}, {"text": "It's really a platonic idea in some ways", "start": 52.5, "duration": 1.58}, {"text": "And it means something like fundamental pattern", "start": 54.26, "duration": 2.88}, {"text": "And so an archetype manifests itself in different ways", "start": 57.78, "duration": 2.72}, {"text": "It could be a pattern of emotional response", "start": 60.5, "duration": 2.04}, {"text": "Like it can be something you are feeling", "start": 62.54, "duration": 1.4}, {"text": "It could be the way that emotional response displays itself", "start": 63.94, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "On your body, on your face", "start": 67.06, "duration": 1.64}, {"text": "It could be the way that emotion feels and displays itself on your face", "start": 68.9, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "And plays itself out as a drama in your local environment", "start": 74.98, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "So like an angry argument is an archetypical phenomenon", "start": 79.84, "duration": 3.56}, {"text": "And the reason it's archetypical is because", "start": 83.4, "duration": 1.9}, {"text": "Well, you have them, you have them, you have them, you have them, everyone has them", "start": 85.54, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "and so you can't  really think about them as individual, you have to think about them as universal", "start": 93.16, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "and you can't think as about something that you created in a sense", "start": 97.08, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "although, in a sense you do", "start": 100.56, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "but it's also as something that happens to you", "start": 102.32, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "now, when you read about Jung and archetype is quite confusing because you can never be sure", "start": 104.96, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "whether it's talking about an instinct, an emotion, a motivational system, or a sub-personality", "start": 110.52, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "or a sub-personality in which these things manifest itself, or even the social drama that's being played out", "start": 118.12, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "in time and space in the social world", "start": 124.48, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "but a real archetype I would say is all of those things at the same time.", "start": 126.72, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "Now, we use archetypal means of expression to represent how we act", "start": 130.16, "duration": 5.8}, {"text": "And that's not the same thing as we think representing what the world is made out of", "start": 135.96, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "It's a very different thing, so you could say in some sense we tell stories and understand stories", "start": 140.34, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "so that we can figure out how people act and how they should act", "start": 144.82, "duration": 3.24}, {"text": "and then we conduct science so that we can figure out what the world's like", "start": 148.06, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "from a material objective perspective and", "start": 151.52, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "the two things coexist uneasily", "start": 154.66, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "I think the more primary form of knowledge is actually how to act with a scientific model nested inside", "start": 156.82, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "because the most important question you have to solve as a living organism isn't what the world is made out of", "start": 163.22, "duration": 5.48}, {"text": "it's how you should act in the world", "start": 168.7, "duration": 1.88}, {"text": "say from a darwinian perspective even", "start": 170.58, "duration": 2.46}, {"text": "so that you can live long enough to reproduce.", "start": 173.04, "duration": 2.44}, {"text": "that's basicly from a strict biological perspective", "start": 175.96, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "in some sense that's what you have to do in order to be successful", "start": 179.72, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "it's kind of obvious", "start": 183.96, "duration": 1.36}, {"text": "first of all 'cause you are not very successful if you just go and die", "start": 185.32, "duration": 2.48}, {"text": "and then, of course, death from a genetic perspective and failing to leave offspring are much the same thing", "start": 187.92, "duration": 7.0}, {"text": "Now, one of the questions might be", "start": 197.28, "duration": 3.68}, {"text": "how is that we conceive of the world as a place to act in", "start": 201.8, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "and that's partly I'm gonna tell on the hypothesis for you and then explain the significance of that hypothesis", "start": 206.96, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "and the hypothesis involves the description of what you might consider consitituent elements", "start": 214.4, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "and also transformation processes", "start": 221.04, "duration": 2.92}, {"text": "as far as I can tell, the constituent elements of the stories that we tell", "start": 224.56, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "about how the people act and should act are characters", "start": 229.96, "duration": 2.84}, {"text": "Now that makes sense, right, because  you really can't have a drama or story without characters", "start": 232.8, "duration": 4.84}, {"text": "Now, the thing is that characters have to be understandable", "start": 238.12, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "and so, for them to be understandable they sort of have to be like you", "start": 241.84, "duration": 3.8}, {"text": "or they have to be like someone you know, but they have to be human", "start": 245.64, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "but than again it's not exactly that they're human, because", "start": 249.08, "duration": 3.32}, {"text": "even when you're telling a story about what happened to you today", "start": 252.4, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "it's interesting to think about what you do", "start": 256.92, "duration": 3.04}, {"text": "so someone might say \"well, how is your day?\", and you say \"fine\"", "start": 260.32, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "i mean, maybe it's the lowest level, lowest resolution highest abstract srory", "start": 265.04, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "\"my day was fine\"", "start": 270.48, "duration": 1.6}, {"text": "It's pretty boring story, it's better then terrible, I suppose", "start": 272.08, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "it's not interesting, it's not detailed", "start": 275.36, "duration": 1.8}, {"text": "but person gets the notion that things went according to plan", "start": 277.28, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "or, more specificly, that things unfolded the way you wanted them to", "start": 283.38, "duration": 3.32}]}
