 "description": "On February, April 19, 2019, I debated Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek in Toronto, April 19 at the Sony Centre. I started with a critique of The Communist Manifesto, which is the central revolutionary document of the Marxist movement. \n\nDr. Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis, and, above all, for the purposes of our debate, Marxism, are world-renowned. The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism.\n\nA good article, I think, on Zizek: https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/#H2\n\nFull debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com/\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",
