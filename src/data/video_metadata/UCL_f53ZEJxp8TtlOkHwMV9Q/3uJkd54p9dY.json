He combined all of these facets of his experience into a phenomenological theory of being and becoming. Rogers regarded all of human experience as equally real, as he saw the necessity of overcoming what he saw as the insufficiently comprehensive doctrine of subjective perceiver and objective reality. He believed that truth and care for his clients, along with careful listening, couldd help orient them towards self-actualization -- the key to mental health. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL
