 "description": "Here is a video outlining the nature of the \"PC Game\" (actually a biased compression algorithm, designed to oversimplify the world and artificially buttress emotional well-being). It also discusses a practical anti-PC tactic: Pokemon PC -- the application of stickers of protest to PC propaganda in educational institutions and other organizations. It's a game, too.  If you're interested, play it. You can purchase the Pokemon PC sticker starter kit on ebay:\n\n50 sticker version: http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/122168195277?\n100 sticker version: http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/122168194525?\n\nRemember, kids, always play Pokemon PC Safely!
