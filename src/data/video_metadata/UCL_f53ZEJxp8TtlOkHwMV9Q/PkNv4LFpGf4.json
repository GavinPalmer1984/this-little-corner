She also claimed that she has been rendered unemployable as an academic (a claim I believe, having served on many university search committees, and knowing full well that any whiff of scandal is enough to disquality a candidate entirely). \n\nI talked to her lawyer after reading her claim, and decided that I would also pursue Wilfred Laurier and the professors and administrators directly responsible for this debacle.\n\nI am not convinced that Wilfred Laurier learned what needed to be learned even after being dragged through the national and international press, in what was the biggest scandal that ever hit a Canadian university. \n\nMaybe two lawsuits will help rectify that. We'll see. \n\nNOTE: The allegations in these statements of claim are simply that, at this stage. They have not been tested in a court of law, and cannot therefore be considered proved. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:
