 "description": "It is very useful from a psychological perspective to understand the distinction between tragedy (an inevitable consequence of limited being) and evil (the production of suffering for suffering's sake). Such knowledge can help reconcile people to life, and aid them in choosing the correct path as they move forward.\n\nSoundCloud Podcast Link: https://goo.gl/Ua4S1c\niTunes Podcast Link: https://goo.gl/L42JTH\n\nProfessor Jordan Peterson discusses the nature of evil, distinguishing it from tragedy, and presenting his ideas on how both the former and the latter might be most effectively dealt with. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
