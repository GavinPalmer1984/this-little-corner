{"video_id": "MnUfXYGtT5Q", "channel_id": "UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "channel_name": "Jordan B Peterson", "title": "Who Dares Say He Believes in God?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnUfXYGtT5Q", "date": "2019-06-08", "description": "And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. (Mark 10:18; see also Luke 18:19).\n\nNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. (Matthew 7:21, KJV). \n\nI have been asked many times by many people if I believe in God. I don't like this question. I generally respond by stating that I act as if God exists, but that's not sufficiently true. Who could do that? Who could conduct themselves with the moral exactitude and care necessary of someone who would dare to make that claim? Either claim? In any case, after being asked the question yet again, when I was in Australia, I decided to attempt to answer it in some detail. \n\nThis lecture, one of the 12 Rules for Life tour talks, was delivered in Sydney Feb 26, 2019, at the International Convention Centre. It was one of six I had professionally video recorded. Five of the six will be released directly on thinkspot, our new social media platform (to be announced in mid-June), as a bonus for direct subscribers (not to worry; there are still more than 50 to be released as audio on the Jordan B Peterson podcast at http://bit.ly/2HUdgnc, so it's not as if there will be any shortage). But I thought YouTube would be appropriate for this, given the potentially broad interest in the topic.\n\nI've made a new playlist for it, too, entitled On (my) Belief in God. Three videos make up that playlist:  this one, a 20 minute talk I did for the Prager summit in May of 2019 (https://youtu.be/vwKCK5EhibM), and an interview/discussion I had with Dennis Prager at the same event (https://youtu.be/j0GL_4cAkhI)\n\n I would recommend watching them in the playlist order, which will be this lecture first, then my Prager talk, then the interview, if you're interested in doing so. I think they make a good group.The idea of belief in God is of extreme importance. I hope that these lectures and interviews add to everyone's understanding of my position and why I hold it.\n\nAs always, thank you very much for your continued support. \n\nThe adjunct videos are also available on the Prager U site: the lecture at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avInTfCd92Q; the interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg\n\nThanks to the Prager U organization for the invitation and opportunity. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12
