 "description": "See https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/events\nI missed mentioning Winnipeg, but it's definitely on the tour. Apologies to the denizens of Manitoba. Nothing personal. \n\nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/podcasts/podcast-episode/48-ben-shapiro/ for podcast version\n\nShapiro discussion starts at 4:10 if you want to skip the tour information. \n\nThis is an alternate posting of Ben Shapiro's May 6 premiere Sunday Special discussion with me (https://bit.ly/2I4czoU). \n\nBen and I had a very intense discussion about the nesting of human perception and cognition in the mythic world - a better discussion, I think, than I've had with anyone.\n\nI've added to the beginning of our discussion an update on available tickets for my US 12 Rules for Life tour, and an announcement of 10 additional Canadian dates (see www.jordanbpeterson.com/events). \n\nI hope you find the discussion useful. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
