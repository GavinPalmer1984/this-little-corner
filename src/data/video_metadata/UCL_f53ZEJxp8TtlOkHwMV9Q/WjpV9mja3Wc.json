This has had dire sociological, political and psychological consequences. It wasn't just that God died. Christ was the symbol of the perfect Western man. What died was that ideal, taking with it direction, purpose and meaning. What emerged was rational nihilism and the predilection towards resentment and authoritarian revenge. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support:
