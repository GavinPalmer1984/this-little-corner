Peterson Podcast - S4: E36", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_SwujfiYk", "date": "2021-07-12", "description": "This episode was recorded on May 7th 2021\n\nOn this episode of the Jordan Peterson Podcast, Jordan is accompanied by American-Canadian theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence M. Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU\u2019s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at\nhttps://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\n\nMore information on Lawrence M. Krauss can be found on his website and Twitter linked below:\nhttps://www.lawrencemkrauss.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/LKrauss1\n\n__________________\n\n[00:00] Introduction.\n[2:00] Jordan kicks things off by positing a description of entropy for discussion relating to complexity in systems of matter, time, and energy.\n[13:00] Krauss expounds on the value of overcoming failure.\n[16:00] Peterson prompts Krauss to expand on times in his career where the redirection of an experiment led to incredible discovery that was not related to his original intention or hypothesis.\n[21:30] The science of cosmology, taking the listeners back to the beginning of our universe through theoretical models.\n[27:00] The size of the universe, is it a reasonable question to ask?\n[41:00] Exploring the concept of time relative to change, space, and matter.\n[44:30] Talking about the creation of the universe looking at matter versus antimatter distribution.\n[56:00] The current picture (based on models of the matter and antimatter at the beginning of the universe).\n[1:01:00] The ability of the laws of physics to fluctuate at different energy levels (scale, size). The formation of all the foundational elements in existence.\n[1:10:00] Quantum fluctuation, quantum mechanics, quantum ground state, the resonant wavelength of electrons, and much more.\n[1:20:30] Lawrence Krauss gives his summarization of the interpretation of quantum mechanics and complexity.\n[1:25:30] Debating meaning, truth, reality, and reason in the universe. The complex and strained relationship between the scientific method and religious instinct towards our existence.\n[1:43:00] Jordan asks Lawrence to comment on the religious instinct removed by modern atheists popping up again in a politicalized form of secular humanism.\n\n#Physics #Religion #LawrenceKrauss\n\nVisit www.jordanbpeterson.com to view more information about Jordan, his books, lectures, social media, blog posts, and more.\n\nJordan B. Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist, and the author of the multi-million copy bestseller 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, and slated for translation into 50 languages.\n\nDr. Peterson has appeared on many popular podcasts and shows, including the Joe Rogan Experience (877, 958, 1006), The Rubin Report, H3H3 (#37), and many more. Dr. Peterson\u2019s own podcast has focused mainly on his lecture series, covering a great deal of psychology and historical content. \n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter:
