Canada currently protects 1.1% of its oceanic territory while the United States of America protects 29.4% and Australia 27.9%(1). Marine Protected Areas allow fish stocks to grow in a safe environment. Without them, fish stocks can be incessantly trawled without regenerating. The lack of oceanic protection is compromising the fishing industry, which currently employs 120 000 people(2) and exports $4.1 billion (CAD)(3) worth of goods every year.\n\nThe Atlantic Cod Fisheries have already collapsed. It was once one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Before 1960, 300 000 tonnes of cod were landed annually on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland(3). However, there was no oceanic protection. In 1992, over 99% of the historical biomass was depleted(4). Widespread unemployment and poverty ensued with 40 000 people in the fishing industry losing their jobs(5).\n\nCanada has repeatedly promised to protect its oceans. In 1995, Canada signed the UN Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing Operations. In 2001, Canada signed the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. These treaties explicitly detail the necessary procedures to preserve fish stocks by protecting the oceans. Since then, other countries have established substantial Marine Protected Areas. Yet, only 1.1% of Canadian oceans are protected.\n\nThe University of Toronto Marine Life Advocacy is deeply concerned about the lack of oceanic protection in Canada. Marine Protected Areas are not just economic necessities, but simultaneously offer environmental and sociological benefits. The Canadian government is responsible for regulating the oceans for fishing industry, the consumers, and the general public. We would like to know why our oceans are still not protected and what might be done about it.\n\nMarine Life Advocacy\nhttp://marinelifeadvocacy.com\n\n1.
