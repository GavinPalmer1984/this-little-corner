He believed that the imagination roamed where articulated knowledge had not yet voyaged, and that it was the artist and visionary who first explored new territory, civilizing it, in essence, for those who came later. The study of Jung makes the dead religious past spring back to life. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:

tremendously powerful visualizer", "start": 82.68, "duration": 2.4}, {"text": "and a lot of what he discovered", "start": 86.4, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "was a consequence of engaging in long-term

205.02, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "he believed that that would lead people to a morally relativistic condition", "start": 210.34, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "that would prove psychologically

worse.", "start": 228.44, "duration": 1.78}, {"text": "And, in the final analysis, you might say, well, there's no good and there's no evil", "start": 230.44, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "and the problem with that is you can't actually orient yourself in a world that has those properties", "start": 234.0, "duration": 5.7}, {"text": "because in order to act, as we've already talked about with regards to the cybernetic models,", "start": 239.78, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "you have to be aiming at something that's better than what you have now", "start": 245.66, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "or there's no reason to expend the energy", "start": 248.86, "duration": 2.28}, {"text": "and so you need the gradient, you need a value differentiation in order to act", "start": 251.14, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "and Nietzsche's analysis", "start": 255.96, "duration": 3.94}, {"text": "was predicated on the idea that if the value hierarchy collapsed", "start": 260.78, "duration": 3.22}, {"text": "well not only would people not be motivated to do anything anymore", "start": 264.0, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "but they would also be extraodinarily confused", "start": 267.48,

consequence of that would be that they would become somewhat nihilistic or maybe absolutely nihilistic", "start": 273.94, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "or that they would turn to ideological, rigid ideological systems as a replacement.", "start": 279.46, "duration": 5.18}, {"text": "Now, what Nietzsche offered as an alternative to that", "start": 285.5, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "was that human beings could create their own values", "start": 290.5, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "and so his idea was that the Superman, the Overman -- depending on how you look at it", "start": 293.1,

can create your own values as an conscious act", "start": 314.0, "duration": 6.86}, {"text": "because it's not obvious that values are consciously created", "start": 321.54, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "And I think this is why the psychoanalysts had so much to add to the philosophical debate", "start": 325.28, "duration": 5.56}, {"text": "at least the philosophical debate that developed to the point of Nietzsche's observations.", "start": 331.0, "duration": 6.46}, {"text": "When Freud entered the scene,", "start": 339.24, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "the idea of the unconscious was in the air, but Freud formalized it to a much greater degree than anyone else had, and", "start": 342.0, "duration": 6.78}, {"text": "Freud's theory really is deeply biological", "start": 348.78, "duration": 5.14}, {"text": "it's biological, it's social as well,", "start": 353.92, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "but his proposition, the proposition that there is an Id", "start": 356.0, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "is fundamentally the proposition that you're not necessarily... Your consciousness, for sure, is not the master in its own house.", "start": 360.04, "duration": 6.9}, {"text": "Now, I think part of the reason that people like to go after Freud --there's a variety of reasons--", "start": 367.64, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "but one of them is, that modern people basically accept radical Freudian presuppositions more or less as givens now", "start": 373.1, "duration": 7.14}, {"text": "So if you are a brilliant thinker and your thought permeates the society to the point where", "start": 380.62, "duration": 5.18}, {"text": "your most radical propositions are accepted by everyone, all that's really left are your errors.", "start": 385.8, "duration": 6.7}, {"text": "And so it's easy to concentrate on Freud's errors because we've already digested everything he had to say that was particularly profound.", "start": 393.02, "duration": 6.6}, {"text": "I don't imagine --perhaps I'm wrong", "start": 400.04, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "but I don't imagine that there's anyone in this room to whom the news that", "start": 402.82, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "many of your motivations aren't conscious", "start": 406.92, "duration": 3.4}, {"text": "comes as a surprise.", "start": 410.72, "duration": 1.04}, {"text": "I mean, even psychologists have admitted that in the last 20 years", "start": 412.02, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "They talked about the cognitive unconscious", "start": 416.64, "duration": 2.36}, {"text": "which I think is a real slight of hand maneuver to stop them from having to credit Freud with his discoveries", "start": 419.04, "duration": 7.5}, {"text": "and I also think that Freud's notion of the unconscious is far more sophisticated than the cognitive scientists' notion", "start": 426.54, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "because Freud viewed the unconscious as a place that was bascially populated by fragmented personalities", "start": 433.02, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "not cognitive schemes of one form or another or not processes", "start": 440.42, "duration": 3.94}, {"text": "but things that were like living beings.", "start": 444.36, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "You know, you think, 'Well are the living beings in your unconscious?'", "start": 446.68, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "And the answer to that is, well, 'are you alive or not?'", "start": 450.0, "duration": 3.32}, {"text": "And you're alive so you're composed of living subcomponents", "start": 453.64, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "and they're not machines, or at least not in any way that we understand machines", "start": 457.4,

Id", "start": 494.5, "duration": 1.82}, {"text": "and Freud thought of the Id really as something that was primordial and primitive", "start": 496.32, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "and that was one of the things that really separated him from Jung.", "start": 508.4, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "I think Jung is much more accurate from the perspective of evolutionary psychology", "start": 511.92,

for European philosophers was like 500 to 2000 years ago", "start": 556.48, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "and Jung thought way past that, way back farther than that.", "start": 561.7, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and started to take into serious account the fact that the origins of our psyche, the ground of our psyche, is deeply biological", "start": 566.08, "duration": 7.74}, {"text": "and that it's an emergent property, so", "start": 573.82, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "for Freud, Freud's idea of the unconscious is somewhat difficult to understand because there's sort of two elements to it.", "start": 575.82, "duration": 5.5}, {"text": "There's the ID, which is the source of primordial motivation", "start": 581.32, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "and Freud concentrated mostly on aggression and sexuality", "start": 585.8, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "and the reason he concentrated on those two", "start": 589.2, "duration": 2.34}, {"text": "--although he concentrated on what he called the death instinct later in his life--", "start": 591.54, "duration": 3.64}, {"text": "the reason he concentrated on those two primarily", "start": 595.18, "duration": 2.98}, {"text": "wasn't because he regarded them necessarily as the most compelling of motivations", "start": 598.16, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "but he regarded those motivations as the ones that were most difficult, for most people", "start": 603.32, "duration": 5.26}, {"text": "to integrate successfully into the social world", "start": 608.58, "duration": 3.42}, {"text": "So he thought that they were most likely to be repressed", "start": 612.42, "duration": 2.92}, {"text": "and therefore underdeveloped and immature.", "start": 615.34, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "And I think that's that's a reasonable proposition", "start": 620.16, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "I think that modern people would have to add eating to that", "start": 624.88, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "because since the time of Freud we've gone, I would say, from a high proportion of sexually related pathologies", "start": 628.36, "duration": 8.48}, {"text": "to a very very high proportion of eating related pathologies", "start": 636.84, "duration": 3.02}, {"text": "but that's in some sense beside the point.", "start": 639.86, "duration": 2.96}, {"text": "So that's one part of the Freudian unconscious, sort of an implicit unconscious,", "start": 643.54, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "and then the other part of the Freudian unconscious is those things that have happened to you that you've repressed", "start": 648.24, "duration": 6.28}, {"text": "because you don't like what they imply.", "start": 654.52, "duration": 4.5}, {"text": "And, you know, those are very different kinds of unconscious", "start": 660.66, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "because one of them is dependent on your experience and the other isn't", "start": 662.98, "duration": 3.26}, {"text": "You can think of Jung, actually, as a deep archaeologist of the Id", "start": 666.24, "duration": 5.72}, {"text": "And Freud though about the Id in sort of primordial terms", "start": 673.3, "duration": 4.28}, {"text": "so his angry Id would be", "start": 677.58, "duration": 3.56}, {"text": "like a beast that's out of control", "start": 683.82, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "but Jung recognized that the unconscious was far more sophisticated, in many ways", "start": 687.04, "duration": 8.9}, {"text": "than the conscious parts of your being.", "start": 695.94, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "And that it guided your adaptation in ways that you didn't understand", "start": 700.82, "duration": 4.38}, {"text": "and that the ways in which it guided your adaptations and structured your understanding were universal,", "start": 705.9, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "hence biological,", "start": 713.7, "duration": 1.62}, {"text": "and far more sophisticated than a somewhat primordial notion of biological drive might indicate.",

forces that ancient people considered deities were personified representations of instinctual systems", "start": 733.6, "duration": 10.78}, {"text": "so here's a way of thinking about it --and this is a way of thinking about the collective unconscious", "start": 744.82, "duration": 3.8}, {"text": "which is Jung's, in some sense, replacement term for the Freudian Id.", "start": 748.62, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "So Mars, for example, was the god of war, Roman god of war", "start": 756.46, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and you might say, 'well, what does it mean for there to be a god of war?'", "start": 761.7, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "or Venus as the god of love, actually of sexual attraction, more particularly", "start": 766.36, "duration": 6.92}, {"text": "or of sexual possession, which is even a better way of thinking about it", "start": 773.28, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "And you say, 'well why would people conceptualize of those phenomena as gods?'", "start": 779.22,

I'm sorry, that was Shakespeare who said that", "start": 790.04, "duration": 2.98}, {"text": "Well, here's one way of thinking about it:", "start": 795.5, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "what's older, you or aggression?", "start": 798.0, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "And the answer to that is, well, you're 23", "start": 802.04, "duration": 2.34}, {"text": "and the system that mediates biological aggression in mammals and their progenitors", "start": 805.06, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "is tens of millions of years old.", "start": 810.42, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "And if you think you

you don't control it at all", "start": 824.8, "duration": 2.98}, {"text": "What happens is that you never go anywhere where you need to use it", "start": 828.5, "duration": 3.58}, {"text": "And so one of the things that happens to soldiers in wartime, for example,", "start": 833.1, "duration": 3.3}, {"text": "is they go somewhere where they could use it", "start": 836.4, "duration": 2.5}, {"text":
