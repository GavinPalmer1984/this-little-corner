However, when our plans go wrong, and we don't get what we want, what we have ignored resurfaces. If the disruption is severe enough, major parts of our identity have to be reconfigured. This can be difficult to the point of trauma. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:
