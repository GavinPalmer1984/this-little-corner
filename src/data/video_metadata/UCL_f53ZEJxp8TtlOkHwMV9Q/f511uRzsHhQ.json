Extraversion is positive emotion, roughly speaking, as Neuroticism is negative emotion (particularly anxiety and pain). Both of those emotions operate within a context provided by motivation, whose primal foundations are based in the hypothalamus. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support:
