C. Hicks (www.stephenhicks.org), Professor of Philosophy at Rockford University, Illinois, USA, Executive Director of the Center for Ethics and Entrepreneurship, and Senior Scholar at The Atlas Society in August of 2017 (http://bit.ly/306ggDQ), and decided that it was time for an update. Dr. Hicks received his Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees from the University of Guelph, Canada, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He has published four books, translated into sixteen different languages:\n\n\u2022 In 1994; 2nd ed 1998 The Art of Reasoning: Readings for Logical Analysis (co-edited with David Kelley, W. W. Norton & Co., 1994, second edition 1998).\n\u2022 In 2010, Nietzsche and the Nazis \n\u2022 In 2016, Entrepreneurial Living (co-edited with Jennifer Harrolle)\n\nThe remaining book, published in 2004 and expanded in 2011, Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, has been particularly relevant to our discussions. It\u2019s available at Amazon.com (https://amzn.to/2Jh4Uro) but also in pdf form on Dr. Hick\u2019s website (http://bit.ly/2MaI9rH). I found it very helpful when trying to understand the intellectual roots of the ideas that appear so dominant in today\u2019s universities.\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 5948, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "Dr. Stephen RC Hicks is professor of philosophy at Rockford University, Illinois USA", "start": 7.65, "duration": 6.649}, {"text": "Executive director of the Center for Ethics and entrepreneurship and senior scholar at the Atlas Society", "start": 15.66, "duration": 6.53}, {"text": "He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Guelph in Canada", "start": 23.61, "duration": 5.569}, {"text": "And his PhD in philosophy from Indiana University, Bloomington", "start": 29.18, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "USA he's published four books", "start": 34.019, "duration": 2.3}, {"text": "Translated into 16 different languages", "start": 37.469, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "in", "start": 40.38, "duration": 1.26}, {"text": "2004 and expanded in 2011.
