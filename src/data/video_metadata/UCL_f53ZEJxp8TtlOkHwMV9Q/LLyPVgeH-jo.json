Which of these traits are nature, and which of them are nurture? Are there personality differences between men and women? All of these questions are addressed in my new course, \"Discovering Personality\", now available for order at https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality.\r\n\nThis 5-hour course is condensed from a semester-long university course on the widely-accepted \"Big 5\" model of personality. Complete with summary notes, transcripts, audio versions, an exclusive members-only discussion group and access to my personality assessment, it has everything you need to help you better understand yourself and others, and orient yourself properly in a complex world.\r\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:
