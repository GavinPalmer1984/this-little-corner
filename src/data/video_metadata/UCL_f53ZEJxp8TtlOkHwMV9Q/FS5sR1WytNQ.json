The broad topic for the day (which also included, among others, Theryn Meyer, Jonathan Pageau and Bret Weinstein) was The New Media: Where it is, Where it's Going, and What that Might Mean for All of US. \n\nI talked about my media experiences from my days with TVO's The Agenda and Big Ideas, as well as the consequences of the video lectures I began to place on YouTube beginning in 2013. Part personal reflection and history, part on-the-fly cultural commentary, this talk is my attempt to come to terms with the new Gutenberg revolution for video and the spoken word.\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS
