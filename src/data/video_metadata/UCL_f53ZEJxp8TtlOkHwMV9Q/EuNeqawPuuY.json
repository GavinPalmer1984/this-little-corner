 "description": "The Montreal Press Club marked the occasion of its 70th anniversary in 2018 by initiating a \u201cFreedom Award\u201d to mark the accomplishments of a single exceptionally courageous individual in the world of journalism. They chose as their first recipient Saudi blogger Raif Badawi (https://www.raifbadawi.org/), who has been tortured and imprisoned for his views by the oh-so-enlightened rulers of that state. I delivered this lecture on free speech on the occasion of the acceptance of the Press Club award by Raif Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, April 26/2018 (video uploaded August 20). \n\nIt is an interesting sidenote that the Blue Metropolis Literary Festival, which held the event in collaboration with the Press Club, disavowed their support (https://twitter.com/metropolisbleu/status/976201304648355840?lang=en) because of the complaints of one Sean Michaels, as I Tweeted here (https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/984217716344094720?lang=en). Journalist Barbara Kay expressed her opinion about all of that here: https://nationalpost.com/opinion/barbara-kay-another-cultural-institution-succumbs-to-jordan-peterson-hysteria\n\nNectarine News (https://thenectarine.ca/) recorded this talk and \nprovided permission for me to repost it. The original can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sz2-6RNkjY\n\nIt's very unlikely that the Saudis are listening. Tyrants don't listen. \n\nAdditional relevant links:\n\nFree Raif Badawi: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/free.badawi/\nMontreal Press Club: http://www.montrealpressclub.com/\nBlue Metropolis: http://bluemetropolis.org/\nThe Post Millenial: https://www.thepostmillennial.com/\n\nAdditional relevant links to my work:\n\nWebsite: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\n\nBooks:\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/10/great-books/\n\n12 Rules for Life Tour: Dates, Cities and Venues: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\n\nSelf Authoring Suite: http://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: http://understandmyself.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\nSupport this channel: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate",
