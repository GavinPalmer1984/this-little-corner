Within a month, it went viral, and he was fired, for \"perpetuating gender stereotypes.\" The problem is that everything James claimed is solidly backed by well-developed scientific literatures. Thus, the company in charge of much of the world's communication has now fired an excellent engineer for citing established scientific truths. \n\nIn this full 50 min interview, James and I discuss his motivations, and the consequences of his actions. We are joined (audio only) by another Google employee who wishes, for obvious reasons, to remain anonymous. \n\nA fund-raiser for James has been established, here: \nhttp://bit.ly/2uuI0lf\n\nHere are a series of references buttressing the claims of James' memo: \n\nSex differences in personality/cognition: \nLynn (1996): http://bit.ly/2vThoy8 \nLippa (2008): http://bit.ly/2vmtSMs\nLippa (2010): http://bit.ly/2fBVn0G\nWeisberg (2011): http://bit.ly/2gJVmEp \nDel Giudice (2012): http://bit.ly/2vEKTUx\n\nLarger/large and stable sex differences in more gender-neutral countries: (These findings run precisely contrary to social constructionist theory:  it's been tested, and it's wrong). \n\nKatz-Gerrog (2000): http://bit.ly/2uoY9c4\nCosta (2001): http://bit.ly/2utaTT3\nSchmitt (2008): http://bit.ly/2p6nHYY\nSchmitt (2016): http://bit.ly/2wMN45j\n\nDifferences in men and women's interest/priorities:\nLippa (1998): http://bit.ly/2vr0PHF\nRong Su (2009): http://bit.ly/2wtlbzU\nLippa (2010): http://bit.ly/2wyfW23\nSee also Geary (2017) blog: http://bit.ly/2vXqCcF\n\nLife paths of mathematically gifted females and males:\nLubinski (2014): http://bit.ly/2vSjSxb\n\nSex differences in academic achievement unrelated to political, economic, or social equality:\nStoet (2015): http://bit.ly/1EAfqOt\n\nBig Five trait agreeableness and (lower) income (including for men):\nSpurk (2010): http://bit.ly/2vu1x6E\nJudge (2012): http://bit.ly/2uxhwQh\n\nThe general importance of exposure to sex-linked steroids on fetal and then lifetime development:\nHines (2015) http://bit.ly/2uufOiv\n\nExposure to prenatal testosterone and interest in things or people (even when the exposure is among females):\nBerenbaum (1992): http://bit.ly/2uKxpSQ\nBeltz (2011): http://bit.ly/2hPXC1c\nBaron-Cohen (2014): http://bit.ly/2vn4KXq\nHines (2016): http://bit.ly/2hPYKSu\n\nPrimarily biological basis of personality sex differences:\nLippa (2008): http://bit.ly/2vmtSMs\nNgun (2010): http://bit.ly/2vJ6QSh\n\nStatus and sex: males and females\nPerusse (1993): http://bit.ly/2uoIOw8\nPerusse (1994): http://bit.ly/2vNzcL6\nBuss (2008): http://bit.ly/2uumv4g\nde Bruyn (2012): http://bit.ly/2uoWkMh\n\nTo quote de Bruyn et al: high status predicts more mating opportunities and, thus, increased reproductive success. \u201cThis is true for human adults in many cultures, both \u2018modern\u2019 as well as \u2018primitive\u2019 (Betzig, 1986). In fact, this theory seems to be confirmed for non-human primates (Cheney, 1983; Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 1991; Dewsbury, 1982; Gray, 1985; Maslow, 1936) and other animals from widely differing ecologies (Ellis, 1995) such as squirrels (Farentinos, 1972), cockerels (Kratzer and Craig, 1980), and cockroaches (Breed, Smith, and Gall, 1980).\u201d Status also increases female reproductive success, via a different pathway: \u201cFor females, it is generally argued that dominance is not necessarily a path to more copulations, as it is for males. It appears that important benefits bestowed upon dominant women are access to resources and less harassment from rivals (Campbell, 2002). Thus, dominant females tend to have higher offspring survival rates, at least among simians (Pusey, Williams, and Goodall, 1997); thus, dominance among females also appears to be linked to reproductive success.\u201d\n\nPersonality and political belief:\nGerber (2010): http://bit.ly/2hOpnHa\nHirsh (2010): http://bit.ly/2fsxIzB\nGerber (2011): http://bit.ly/2hJ1Kjb\nXu (2013):
