That campaign (http://bit.ly/2pS0knc) ends in 16 hours, as of 10:30 AM Saturday May 6/17. \n\nWe are studying the personality basis of political belief (including political correctness), among other things, explained briefly in this video. \n\nThank you to Mr. Levant and all of the 2500 people who contributed more than $180,000 to this campaign. It is much appreciated and we will do our best to put it to good, practical use. \n\nLink to the interview doctoral student Christine Brophy and I did on political correctness and its psychology with
