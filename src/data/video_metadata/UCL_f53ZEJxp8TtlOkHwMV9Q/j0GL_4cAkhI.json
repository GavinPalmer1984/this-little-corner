It's really a discussion about two previous talks, for a collection of three. I would recommend watching them in the following order: \n\nFirst, watch Who Dares Say He Believes in God? (https://youtu.be/MnUfXYGtT5Q). That lecture was part of my 12 Rules for Life tour, and took place in Sydney, Australia, Feb 26, 2019. \n\nSecond, watch the lecture I gave just before this discussion at the  Prager summit: On Claiming Belief in God: Commentary (https://youtu.be/vwKCK5EhibM),.\n\nThen watch this discussion. \n\nThe three presentations will make the most sense in that order, which is why I placed them in the same playlist, On (My) Belief in God: http://bit.ly/2I6g0hq\n\nThis discussion is also available at the PragerU YouTube Video Channel at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg.
