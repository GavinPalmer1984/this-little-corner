They begin the discussion by talking about the forming of the international translation teams.\n[02:00] The healing effect of Jordan's lectures. The outcry for new material from Jordan\u2019s catalog of books, lectures, and podcasts has been overwhelming. \n[04:00] Espousing the profundity of Eric Neumann\u2019s works in his \u201cThe Origins and History of Consciousness and The Great Mother.\u201d\n[05:20] Peterson comments on another personal favorite author of his, Mircea Eliade, and his history of religious ideas - an anthropological and sociological assessment of religion that\u2019s also deeply psychological.\n[06:40] How Russians respond to Jordan's affinity for Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Mikail details the feelings of the Russian people by their portrayal after the fall of communism.\n[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society have done: a very difficult question because we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and avoid making the same mistakes twice.\n[13:30] Examining the trope that all white people are racist; the existential guilt of history.\n[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to hold that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world (in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory) and that\u2019s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strict rationality in the human experience.\n[24:00] Gibson\u2019s visual perception theory. Value is the key to our perception of the world around us.\n[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience.\n[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if left unchecked.\n[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner - but that is not the rule.\n[45:45] On the importance of beauty in personal experiences as well as the collective human experience.\n[51:00] Differences between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche; closeness to the ideal of beauty\n[56:30] The complexity of the language of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. What is Jordan's process for increasing precision in writing and speech? \n[1:03:30] The divinity of the true word and the way this has been translated through Jordan\u2019s book Beyond Order. Peterson's philosophy behind good writing and text structure of a truly complete work.\n[1:13:40] Mikhaila Peterson\u2019s strength in the face of a great deal of suffering in her life. How wonderful it is to see her succeeding in personal endeavors like her podcast.\n[1:20:15] Fostering children\u2019s individual growth and love of learning.\n[1:32:00] Wrapping up \n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit \nhttps://advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",
