We discuss his experience in the military and war; exploring time in the Navy Seals, Afghanistan, and Iraq. \n\nJocko recounts what it looks like to be on the ground in combat scenarios and the requirement of strong leadership in the Seal teams. I ask him about his formative years growing up with a warrior personality. We cover other engaging points of interest in his kid books, time as an English major, restarting a clothing line in a dying factory town, and much more.\n\nJocko Willink is an American author, podcaster, and retired naval officer who served in the Navy SEALs. His books include New York Times bestseller Extreme Ownership,  Discipline Equals Freedom a field manual, and his children\u2019s book The Way of the Warrior Kid.
