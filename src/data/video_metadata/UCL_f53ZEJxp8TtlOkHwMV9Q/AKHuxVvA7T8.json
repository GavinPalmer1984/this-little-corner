 "description": "I was recently invited to speak at Linfield College, McMinnville, Oregon, by the Young Americans for Liberty. The talk had been booked for months, I had my plane tickets and reservations, the hall was ready.... But then the Linfield administration saw fit to disinvite me. So I gave my honorarium to the student group and they rented another venue. \n\nThis video has the invitation letter, my response, and the subsequent talk, entitled Ethics and Free Speech. \n\nThanks to YAL for hosting me.\n\nVideo of lecture from Joe Tyndall (I hope that's all right with him): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3gztiMdsGA&t=160s\n\nSource: https://youtu.be/X3gztiMdsGA\n\nSpeak Freely Series: https://www.facebook.com/LinfieldSpea...\nLinfield YAL Chapter: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Linfi...\nLinfield Review: http://thelinfieldreview.com\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
