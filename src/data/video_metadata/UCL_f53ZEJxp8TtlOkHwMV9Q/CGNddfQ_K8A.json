Subsequent podcasts will be released every Sunday, featuring lectures about issues of profound psychological and social importance, and discussions with leading scientists, philosophers and authors. I\u2019m also very happy that I will be joined in this revised podcast by my daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, who will serve as co-host and discussant. It\u2019s a project we have both been excited to develop and are looking forward to continually improving. We hope that the Westwood One partnership will improve the quality of our production and introduce many new listeners to the Jordan B Peterson podcast. \n\nThe podcast can be accessed on my website, Spotify and iTunes  and on many other popular podcast apps. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 53, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "I'm very pleased to announce the new", "start": 0.38, "duration": 4.709}, {"text": "partnership between Westwood One", "start": 3.03, "duration": 5.01}, {"text": "America's largest audio network and the", "start": 5.089, "duration": 5.501}, {"text": "Jordan B Peterson podcast with the", "start": 8.04, "duration": 4.71}, {"text": "premiere episode released this Sunday", "start": 10.59, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "March 24th subsequent podcasts will be", "start": 12.75, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "released every Sunday", "start": 16.47, "duration": 3.27}, {"text": "featuring lectures about issues of", "start": 17.91, "duration": 3.69}, {"text": "profound psychological and social", "start": 19.74, "duration": 4.379}, {"text": "importance and discussions with leading", "start": 21.6, "duration": 5.849}, {"text": "scientists philosophers and authors I'm", "start": 24.119, "duration": 5.49}, {"text": "also very happy that I will be joined in", "start": 27.449, "duration": 4.23}, {"text": "this revised podcast by my daughter", "start": 29.609, "duration": 4.441}, {"text": "Mikaela Petersen who will serve as", "start": 31.679, "duration": 5.611}, {"text": "co-host and discussant it's a project we", "start": 34.05, "duration": 5.13}, {"text": "have both been excited to develop and", "start": 37.29, "duration": 3.9}, {"text": "are looking forward to continually", "start": 39.18, "duration": 5.039}, {"text": "improving we hope that the Westwood one", "start": 41.19, "duration": 4.92}, {"text": "partnership will improve the quality of", "start": 44.219, "duration": 3.871}, {"text": "our production and introduced many new", "start": 46.11, "duration": 5.81}, {"text": "listeners to the podcast", "start": 48.09, "duration": 3.83}]}
