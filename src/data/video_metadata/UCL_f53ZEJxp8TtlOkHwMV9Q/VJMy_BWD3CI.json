I was invited by the Center for the Study of Liberal Democracy (https://csld.wisc.edu/), and would like to thank them for that. In this talk, I tried to marry my objections to ideology (particularly the radical leftist ideology that is currently dominant in the humanities and, to a lesser degree, the social sciences) and to explain how ideologies parasitize the cognitive structures and symbolic language that characterize truly archetypal and complete world representation.\n\nCo-Director of the Center: Dr. Richard
