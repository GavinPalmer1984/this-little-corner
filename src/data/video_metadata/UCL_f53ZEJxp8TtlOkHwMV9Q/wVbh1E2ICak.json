I was prompted to do so by Ms. Mengjie Ma, a Chinese student studying in Germany, who has worked diligently to translate and subtitle a number of my videos. I have placed links to these in the description of the video.\n\nMengjie has organized a number of people to work on the translations. They have a group on Weibo: http://bit.ly/2ExqaHn\n\nThanks, Mengjie. Much appreciated.\n\nI would also like to announce that my new book, 12 Rules for Life, will be translated into Chinese by Beijing Cheers Books (http://bit.ly/2Gn2K49). I don\u2019t know the publication date yet, but will let everyone know as soon as I do know. Links to the publisher are also in the description. \n\nI am very pleased to hear that my lectures are finding an audience in China.\n\nBye for now.\n\nTranslated Videos: \n\nOn education: http://bit.ly/2C3FTfO\nOn telling the truth:  http://bit.ly/2CqAQlp\nOn postmodernism:  http://bit.ly/2Hmvqvz\nOn Google censorship: http://bit.ly/2ocQnjw \nOn women being unhappy: http://bit.ly/2C34cuy\nOn malevolence: http://bit.ly/2EArK7z\nChannel 4 interview: \nhttp://bit.ly/2GjXYVa\nhttp://bit.ly/2CtJaB2 \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 62, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "I am making this video to say hi to my viewers and listeners in China", "start": 0.48, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "and also to wish them Happy New Year.", "start": 5.5, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "I was prompted to do so by Ms", "start": 8.22, "duration": 2.24}, {"text": "Meng Jie Ma, a Chinese student studying in Germany, who has worked diligently to translate and subtitle a number of my videos", "start": 10.46, "duration": 7.88}, {"text": "I've placed links to those in the description of this video", "start": 18.78, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "Meng Jie has also organized a number of people to work on the translations", "start": 22.96, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "They have a group on Weibo, which I have linked to in the description", "start": 27.3, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "Thanks, Meng Jie", "start": 32.02, "duration": 1.41}, {"text": "much appreciated.", "start": 33.43, "duration": 1.89}, {"text": "I would also like to announce that my new book \"12 rules for life\" will be translated into Chinese and published by Beijing Cheers books.", "start": 35.32, "duration": 8.34}, {"text": "I don't know the publication date yet, but I will let everyone know as soon as I do.", "start": 43.66, "duration": 4.92}, {"text": "Links to the publisher are also in the description.", "start": 49.12, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "I am extremely pleased to hear that my lectures are finding an audience in China and Happy New Year to everyone there.", "start": 52.2, "duration": 7.58}, {"text": "Bye, for now.", "start": 60.28, "duration": 2.0}]}
