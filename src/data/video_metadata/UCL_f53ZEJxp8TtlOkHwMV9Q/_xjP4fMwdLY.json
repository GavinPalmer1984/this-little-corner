The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. Facilitated by new technology, it\u2019s made a new kind of conversation possible; more in-depth, more open and more democratic. Fuelled by social media, many have become trapped in reaction and ideology, yet big questions can only be explored with open-minded, self-reflective, grounded conversations.\"\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS
