 "description": "This is the video that caused the recent media storm over Bill C-16 and free speech. In it I outline my concerns about political correctness. \n\nSubscribe. Support this channel's development at https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3019121. \n\nAudio only version available at http://snip.ly/sfzp1\n\nThis is a one hour discussion of political correctness. It is the first of a planned three part series on the topic. Part I deals with the fear that PC types are producing, and the profound legal ramifications of their continual activism. Part II is a case study, assessing the PC-ification of the University of Toronto HR department.\n\nPart III is a description of what can be done at the individual level to oppose political correctness and its dangerously totalitarian aspirations. \n\nPlease share this with anyone interested. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
