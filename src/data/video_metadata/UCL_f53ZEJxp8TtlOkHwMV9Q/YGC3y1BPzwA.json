{"video_id": "YGC3y1BPzwA", "channel_id": "UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "channel_name": "Jordan B Peterson", "title": "A Call to Rebellion for Ontario Legal Professionals", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGC3y1BPzwA", "date": "2017-10-10", "description": "Ontario lawyers/paralegals: Indicate your objection to the Law Society demands (confidentiality ensured) at http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj. Please forward this video URL to your colleagues. \n\nConcerned non-lawyers, please contact the Law Society at:  lawsociety@lsuc.on.ca  \n\n(It can be difficult for individual lawyers to stand up against such unwarranted intrusion singly. In consequence, we established the website to generate an estimate of the degree of dissatisfaction and resistance. The number of signatories will be made public, on that same website, within the first week--and updated regularly--but no personally identifying details will be released. ) \n\nSummary: Recently, the Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario) has made major revisions to their requirements for the annual submission for legal practitioners in that province. As part of a five-part strategic program known as \u201cAccelerating Culture Shift,\u201d all lawyers are now required to write, submit and abide by a \"Statement of Principles.\" The details can be viewed here https://www.lsuc.on.ca/EDI/ -- a site which indicates what lawyers now need to \u201cKNOW AND DO\u201d (caps in the original) for 2017. \n\nIn this video, I discuss this new demand (enforced by the power of government and law) with practicing lawyer Jared Brown and Professor Bruce Pardy of Queen\u2019s University, both of whom testified, along with me, last year at the Canadian Senate on the compelled speech required by federal Bill C-16. \n\nThe content of the now-mandatory \u201cStatement of Principles\u201d has been dictated and will be reviewed for compliance by the Law Society itself: Acknowledgement of the \u201cobligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in\u2026 behavior towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public.\u201d This is part of a broader claim by the same society of systemic racism endemic in the legal profession in Ontario \u2013 a claim for which very little credible evidence has been collected and distributed. \n\nFurthermore, the Society now requires every legal workplace of 10 or more licensees to \u201cdevelop, implement and maintain a human rights/diversity policy\u201d and to undergo an \u201cequality, diversity and inclusion self-assessment for their legal workplace, to be provided to the Law Society\" (which will also \u201cencourage legal workplaces to conduct inclusion surveys by providing them with sample templates.\u201d)\n\nFailure to do comply brings with it the threat of serious penalties, including reputational damage and, more seriously, loss of the right to practice. \n\nBy implementing such requirements the Law Society has shifted from an organization ensuring competent practice to one dedicated to policing political and philosophical attitude and behavior. This is a clear and egregious example of compelled speech, and should be rejected as unacceptable by those at whom it is aimed. \n\nTo indicate your objections, once again (lawyers only, please, for this purpose): http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj \n\nConfidentiality is ensured.\n\nProfessor Pardy's October 12 CBC interview: http://bit.ly/2wRwamo\nProfessor Pardy's National Post article can be found at:
