 "description": "On December 13, 2018, I was a guest on Femsplainers with Christina Hoff Sommers and Danielle Crittenden. We discussed, among other topics, the secrets of a long marriage, the problems with dating apps, how to handle a belligerent toddler, and the motivation of my radical feminist critics. \n\nFemsplainers (http://femsplainers.com/) is \u201cthe gossipy, smart, witty conversation you\u2019d have if all of your girlfriends (and some of your guy friends too!) were experts on the hot topics of the moment. High spirited and high minded, we don\u2019t argue or whine but seek to get to the heart of the matter, over cocktails (or wine).\u201d We taped in front of a live audience at AEI, the American Enterprise Institute (http://www.aei.org/\n\nMs. Hoff Sommers is the author of Who Stole Feminism? (https://amzn.to/2GJnkR4) and The War Against Boys (https://amzn.to/2SeuYo5) (a NY Times Notable Book of the Year) as well as Freedom Feminism (https://amzn.to/2Sfrd1B) , One Nation Under Therapy (https://amzn.to/2rNABOe) (with Dr. S. Satel), and The Science on Women in Science (https://amzn.to/2RaZyS1). She is resident scholar at AEI, studying the politics of gender and feminism, as well as free expression, due process, and the preservation of liberty in the academy. She has written for The Journal of Philosophy, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Wall Street Journal, The NY Times, The Washington Post, The New Republic, Slate, The Daily Beast, and The Atlantic, and is host of the popular video blog, The Factual Feminist. \n\nMs. Crittenden is the author of What Our Mothers Didn\u2019t Tell Us (https://amzn.to/2BBtzAC), a novel, AmandaBright@Home (https://amzn.to/2Lwr33c) (the first modern work of fiction serialized in the Wall Street Journal) and a cookbook, From a Polish Country House Kitchen (https://amzn.to/2Ra1H0n)(with Pulitzer-prize winner Anne Applebaum). She is a contributing editor to the Huffington Post, and has published in the Wall Street Journal, the NY Times, the Washington Post, and the Daily Telegraph. A former columnist for the New York Post, Ms. Crittendon has appeared on NBC\u2019s Today show as well as CSPAN, MSNBC, PBS, CNN, and NPR.\n\nFor more videos from Christina Hoff Sommers and the rest of AEI\u2019s scholars, subscribe to their YouTube channel: https://goo.gl/WW5Zdm\n\nNOTE: AEI operates independently of any political party and does not take institutional positions on any issues. AEI scholars, fellows, and their guests frequently take positions on policy and other issues. When they do, they speak for themselves and not for AEI or its trustees or other scholars or employees.
