In this video, I talk about the background of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, and read a subsection from Rule 3: Make Friends with People Who Want The Best For You. It's about the small northern town where I grew up, and the friends I made and lost there.  The discussion also serves as a good introduction to the material you can find on my YouTube channel. \n\nBoulder Scene: the incomparable Buster Keaton, who did all his own stunts. Seven Chances (1925) with Buster Keaton.  I only extracted a a short clip. The entire chase scene, which involves, among other stunts, Keaton riding a motorbike while sitting on the handles, is among the best ever filmed. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
