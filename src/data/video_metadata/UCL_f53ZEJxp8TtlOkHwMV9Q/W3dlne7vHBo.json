 "description": "My daughter @Mikhaila Peterson and I had the pleasure of speaking with the remarkable @Wim Hof. The full episode is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ALm2M09qA\n\nAttention: BEFORE attempting to follow the Wim Hof breathing exercise, please view this safety information - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFSL_Qk9qKw\n\n- Don't take the method and techniques too lightly, they go deep and the effects can have a huge impact.\n- Don't do the breathing exercises in a swimming pool, before going underwater, beneath the shower or piloting any vehicle, without proper supervision. Always practice in a safe environment.\n- Keep in mind to do the exercises without forcing them, gradually build-up, and don't exceed your limits.\n\nFind more of Wim Hof in his book \"The Wim Hof Method\" and on his website https://www.wimhofmethod.com\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
