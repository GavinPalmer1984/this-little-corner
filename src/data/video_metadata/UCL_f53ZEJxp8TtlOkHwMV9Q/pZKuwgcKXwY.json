Host of what is perhaps the most widely known podcast in the world, the Joe Rogan Experience, he is also a former martial arts champion, a TV star (Hardball and News Radio, Fear Factor), a UFC commentator, and an exceptionally successful standup comedian, with several Netflix specials under his belt, as well as numerous comedy CDs.  \n\nHe's a very effective and engaing interviewer. He asks tough questions. He has his own point of view. But he listens, and he treats his audience with respect. They return the favor, with hundreds of millions downloading his podcast and watching the Joe Rogan Experience on YouTube (http://bit.ly/2XmYcXP) with more than 5.5 million subscribers. \n\nHe's been a great friend to me. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 9574, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "Guess the first thing I'd like to just ask you is how are you doing?", "start": 3.029, "duration": 3.409}, {"text": "I'm doing great.
