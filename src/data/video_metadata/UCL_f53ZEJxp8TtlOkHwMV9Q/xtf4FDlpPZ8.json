Our conversation was taped by Perspectiva (http://bit.ly/2EOCiU0), who described it as follows: \"An extraordinary half-hour conversation about the brain, chaos, order, freedom, evil, mythology, being, and becoming between two of the leading thinkers of our time.\"\n\nDr. McGilchrist's book (Amazon description: a fascinating exploration of the differences between the brain\u2019s left and right hemispheres, and how those differences have affected society, history, and culture) is available here:\n\nAmazon US: http://amzn.to/2BABakL\nAmazon Canada: http://amzn.to/2EBjQis\nAmazon UK:
