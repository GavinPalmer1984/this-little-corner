He\u2019s not dull, for starters. Talking to him gave me the same sense of drinking from a fire hose that I experienced talking to Camille Paglia, who is one of the only people I have ever met who could give him a run for his money for sheer verbal fluency. He\u2019s not someone whose existence you could believe in him if he wasn\u2019t real, either. In fact, when I first heard about him, I thought \u201cthere\u2019s just no way all those things can be true.\u201d\nBut they are. \nHis first and longest lasting love has been science. At sixteen, he worked as a research assistant studying the immune system at the Roswell Park Memorial Research Cancer Institute. While attending NYU, he edited an art magazine, to substantial critical acclaim, then an underground rock magazine (even though he knew very little, to begin with, about rock), and then head of public relations at ABC, working for Simon & Garfunkel, Michael Jackson, the Talking Heads, AC/DC, and Bob Marley (among many others). In 1985 the acts he handled grossed a third of a billion dollars. \nHe\u2019s also cofounded and chaired the Asian Space Technology Summit and serves on the board of the National Space Society.\nWe talked about many things: the perils of his isolated childhood, his severe bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, his interest in ecstatic collective experiences \u2013 and we barely scratched the surface. \nHe\u2019s written six books:\nHow I Accidentally Started the Sixties (2017): an autobiographical work charting a decade of revolution and chaos:  Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2jDbZnd); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2i723lk)\nThe Muhammad Code (2016), his controversial work on Islam and terrorism: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2jCAGQz); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2i9w0RZ)\nThe God Problem (2012): how a Godless cosmos creates: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2AoZBit); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jCQ8vP)\nThe Genius of the Beast (2009), his radical revisioning of capitalism: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2Akj6uH); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2kdyWRM)\nGlobal Brain (2001), about the deep evolutionary roots of the mass mind: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2i6F2yX); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jE4GLJ)\nThe Lucifer Principle (1997), about history, biology and evil: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2i73rV4); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jE4KuX)\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 5341, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "So I'm here tonight talking to Howard bloom", "start": 14.86, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "Who's a fascinating person and an an author of many books and a polymath of sorts and we've known each other by?", "start": 19.02, "duration": 7.709}, {"text": "Electronic communication for quite a long time, it's it's something exceeding a decade", "start": 27.52, "duration": 4.069}, {"text": "but we've never met either in person or electronically by video until now and", "start": 32.169, "duration": 5.18}, {"text": "Howard is definitely well he's a singular sort of person and he has a very broad range of knowledge", "start": 38.65, "duration": 4.969}, {"text": "As broad as anyone I've ever encountered", "start": 44.14, "duration": 2.569}, {"text": "I would say and so what I'm going to do first is turn this over to him so that he can tell you a little", "start": 46.71, "duration": 4.589}, {"text": "bit about himself and about what he's done and", "start": 51.299, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "Then we're gonna talk about his newest book which is called how I accidentally started the 60s and then well", "start": 53.83, "duration": 5.389}, {"text": "We're gonna see where it goes from there, so Howard.
