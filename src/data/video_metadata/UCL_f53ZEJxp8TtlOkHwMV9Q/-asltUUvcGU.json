Dr. Daly has determined that economic inequality and male on male homicide rates are strongly linked, and makes a causal argument for why this is the case, attributing it to status competition under stressful conditions.\n\nThe discussion begins with rap artist Baba Brinkman's Survival of the Fittest. \n\nBaba's YouTube channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/user/babasword\nYou can support his
