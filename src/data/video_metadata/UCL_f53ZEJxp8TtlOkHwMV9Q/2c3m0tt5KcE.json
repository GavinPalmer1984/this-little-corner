The world in such stories is a place of action, not a place of things, and it has its archetypal characters, positive and negative. Culture is typically represented as paternal, nature as maternal, and the individual as hero and adversary. Culture offers people security, but threatens them with tyranny. Nature offers renewal, but also brings death. The religious path of meaning allows people to negotiate this archetypal landscape. \n\nPodcast link: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcasts/podcast-episode/episode-1/\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL
