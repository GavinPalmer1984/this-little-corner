We didn't record video this time.\n\nI agreed to the interview in the hopes of having questions about my health over the past two years addressed by a reliable media once and for all before the release of my new book Beyond Order in March. This was done partly at my publisher's request.\n\nMikhaila fielded the initial questions to help reduce the stress I experience in recounting the events in question. She also remembers more of what happened. She was also part of my interview at my request to ensure it didn\u2019t continue for too long and to make sure that I didn't get excessively fatigued.\n\nMikhaila suggested we put my interview first as this is addressed to my audience, although my interview took place the day after hers. Her interview starts at 1:26:30.  \n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering
