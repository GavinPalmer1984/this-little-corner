The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism. The live tickets have already sold out. We have therefore decided to experiment with live-streaming the discussion. You can subscribe to the livestream at PetersonvsZizek.com. That\u2019s PetersonvsZizek.com. It comes at a cost \u2013 14.95. This enables us to produce it professionally and to ensure, we hope, that the broadcast is of high quality and reliable, as well as to produce whatever profit might ensue. Dr Zizek, by the way, has announced his intention to donate his share to charity. \n\nNote: I am still going to post the video recording on YouTube and audio on podcast, in mid-May, in the same manner as usual. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 178, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hi everyone I'm in Manhattan today", "start": 0.469, "duration": 6.401}, {"text": "talking to my publishers penguin Random", "start": 4.23, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "House about my next book but I thought", "start": 6.87, "duration": 4.41}, {"text": "I'd take this opportunity to make an", "start": 9.21, "duration": 3.63}, {"text": "announcement that you might find of", "start": 11.28, "duration": 5.7}, {"text": "interest as some of you may know and the", "start": 12.84, "duration": 5.939}, {"text": "rest of you are learning now I'm", "start": 16.98, "duration": 4.139}, {"text": "debating Marxist philosopher Slava as", "start": 18.779, "duration": 5.371}, {"text": "Dziedzic in Toronto April 19th at the", "start": 21.119, "duration": 6.66}, {"text": "Sony Center dr.
