The first shows sold out, so there's wasn't much point announcing them by video. However, seats are still available for Wellington (21/02), Auckland (23/02), Sydney (26/02), Melbourne (27/02) and Brisbane (28/02). Hope to see you there. \n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12
