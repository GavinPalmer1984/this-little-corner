 "description": "An open conversation with Rex Murphy about the modern state of education, politics, identity, and new media. Recorded in early September. For those international viewers, unfamiliar with Canadian media, it will be useful for you to know that Rex Murphy is one of Canada's premier journalists: tough, truthful, politically correct, and possessed of a singular style and character. It was both an honor and a pleasure to meet him. I highly recommend his channel.
