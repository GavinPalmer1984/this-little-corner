 "description": "On Jan 23rd 2017 I was invited by the Runnymede Society, a law student group, to debate Bill C16, a Canadian Federal bill that adds gender identity and gender expression to the list of protected groups in Canada, and makes discrimination in those categories a form of hate speech. Professor Bruce Pardy (http://bit.ly/2ljWlMB) spoke in support of the law and its accompanying policies. SPOILER ALERT: The Runnymede society approached six different law school professors, trying to find someone who would debate me, without success. Professor Pardy played devil's advocate.\n\nRunnymede Society: www.runnymedesociety.ca\nLink to same video on Runnymede Society webpage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzkNHpiJ7AE&t=1899s\n\nIntro, Joanna Baron: 0:00\nOpening, Bruce Pardy: 1:35\nOpening, Jordan Peterson: 16:19\nRebuttal, Bruce Pardy: 32:00\nRebuttal, Jordan Peterson: 37:24\nStudent Q&A: 42:45 \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
