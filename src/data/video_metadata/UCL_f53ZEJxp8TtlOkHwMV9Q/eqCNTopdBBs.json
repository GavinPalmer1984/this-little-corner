 "description": "The Coddling of the American Mind on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2QJ20MQ\n\nConsider this book as a gift for your local school board member, teacher or principal. The more educational professionals become aware of the issues it presents, and the dangers of our current hyper-protective preoccupations, the better the chances we'll change course. \n\nI spoke with Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt September 18, 2018 about their new book, The Coddling of the American Mind -- a treatise on the counterproductive but increasingly predominant \"safety culture\" of trigger warnings, safe spaces and microaggression sensitivity. \n\nWe discussed the psychological and sociological factors that underlie this philosophy of fragility, over-protection and offense, considering the contribution of older parents, fewer siblings, the strange interaction of postmodern philosophy and Marxism on campuses, and the widespread use of social media by young people.\n\nWe focused on the increasing proclivity of those teaching in the social sciences and humanities to characterize Western culture as patriarchal and oppressive; producing, as a secondary consequence, a pervasive and all-encompassing victim/victimizer narrative (and producing that partly for the purposes of justifying that characterization). \n\nWe considered what steps might be taken, personally and socially, to produce an alternate culture of resilience, responsibility, strength and courage.\n\nHere are some links specifically relevant to our discussion: \n\nBook website: www.thecoddling.com\nWebsite of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education): www.thefire.org\nAdvice and research on free-range parenting: www.letgrow.org\n\nBooks by Greg Lukianoff:\n\nUnlearning Liberty: https://amzn.to/2Dl5WAO\nFIRE\u2019s guide to free speech on campus: https://bit.ly/2Oz7zM7\nFreedom from speech: https://amzn.to/2QNZCV4\n\nBooks by Jonathan Haidt:\n\nThe Righteous Mind: https://amzn.to/2OCG1pl\nThe Happiness Hypothesis: https://amzn.to/2piKSkp\nAll Minus One (John Stuart Mill on free speech, illustrated): https://amzn.to/2QH1zT9\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
