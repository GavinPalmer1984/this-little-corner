I agreed, and the talk was scheduled for Monday, April 24. This caused some controversy, as the typical suspects began to express their concern about safe spaces. On April 18, the talk was summarily canceled, despite the flight and accommodation bookings. I gave the host students permission to use my honorarium to book an alternative venue.\n\nIt was Susan Agre-Kippenhan, VP Academic Affairs, who made the decision to disinvite me (http://www.linfield.edu/academic-affairs.html)\n\nThe President is Dr. Thomas L. Hellie (http://www.linfield.edu/president.html)\n\nIf you decide to contact either of these individuals, please articulate your arguments conservatively and carefully. It's intelligence and clarity that will win this battle, and nothing else. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 864, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "so back in February I received the", "start": 0.65, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "following letter from a student at", "start": 5.13, "duration": 4.77}, {"text": "Linfield College and according to its", "start": 6.81, "duration": 6.6}, {"text": "website with campuses in McMinnville", "start": 9.9, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "Portland and a prestigious online", "start": 13.41, "duration": 4.83}, {"text": "program Linfield College is a premier", "start": 15.96, "duration": 4.319}, {"text": "choice in the Pacific Northwest for a", "start": 18.24, "duration": 4.14}, {"text": "high quality traditional liberal arts", "start": 20.279, "duration": 5.461}, {"text": "education want to learn more contact us", "start": 22.38, "duration": 5.01}, {"text": "for details about our degree and", "start": 25.74, "duration": 5.49}, {"text": "certificate program offerings a student", "start": 27.39, "duration": 7.29}, {"text": "there who I won't name sent me the", "start": 31.23, "duration": 6.11}, {"text": "follow letter here dr.
