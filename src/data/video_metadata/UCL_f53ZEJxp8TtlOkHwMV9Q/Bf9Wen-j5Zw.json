 "description": "There are two videos from Iceland, covering different material. This is the second. The first is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_QPCxCkws\n\nI have been touring since January, discussing my books, 12 Rules for Life and, to a lesser extent, Maps of Meaning (see www.jordanbpeterson.com/events for details, including upcoming tour dates and cities.  \n\nI was in Iceland in June and gave two lectures (June 04, Lecture 1; June 05, Lecture 2), followed by a Q and A. I was hosted by Gunnlaugur Jonsson, who also introduced both talks.\n\nI've been using the lectures as an opportunity to extend, develop and publicly test the ideas I presented in 12 Rules and Maps of Meaning.\n\nMy wife Tammy and I had a remarkable and memorable trip to Iceland. My mother and aunt also came for the adventure, and were treated with exceptional care by Gunnlaugur and his crew. We are looking forward to returning to Iceland in 2019,\n\nThank you very much to Halld\u00f3r Fannar Kristj\u00e1nsson (Sigurgeirsson) for the video recording and editing. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
