 "description": "Today, Friday, December 2, 2016, Lord Conrad Black wrote an article about the Pronoun Wars in the National Post: http://natpo.st/2fVyHTE\n\nLord Black underestimates the seriousness of the law, because of the absurdity of the issue. That's an error. I explain why. In addition, I read a legal opinion on the matter, indicating that my caution about the dangerous of imprisonment for violating Bill C-16 and its associated legislation is far from unjustified. Canadians, pay attention and beware -- and the rest of the world, too. \n\nLegal opinion: D. Jared Brown\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
