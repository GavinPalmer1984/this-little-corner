 "description": "Every time I talk publicly about the relationship between responsibility and meaning, the audience falls silent...\n\nTimon Dias, editor of Geenstijl, the largest Dutch weblog, interviewed me, for the second time, on January 6th (we had spoken a year before: https://bit.ly/2Ay0k2i). \n\nThis interview covered: \n\n1. a review of my lecture tour and other activities last year;\n2. the political-correctness-inspired attempt to replace the narrative of individual identity with that of the collective;\n3. The archetypal structure of the movie \"Gladiator\";\n4. The role of the artist as mediator between the dream world and consciousness;\n5. The idea of individuation (a concept of Carl Jung).\n\nGeenstijl can be found here:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/2Vv1owF\nTwitter: @geenstijl \u200f\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/geenstijlnl\n\nTimon Dias on Twitter:  @TimonDias\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
