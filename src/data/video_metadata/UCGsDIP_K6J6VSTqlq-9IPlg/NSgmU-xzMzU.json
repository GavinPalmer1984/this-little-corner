 "description": "This present crisis is a good opportunity to watch yourself and learn. The dramatic changes will force all of us to update how we see the world. One word for this is sense-making. In this crisis we will watch ourselves go through four stages of sense-making. \n\nSkepticism: We test and evaluate the new input\nAlarm: We mobilize to face the threat. Panic is TOO much alarm and is unproductive. \nAdjustment: What do we need to change to meet the threat\nSustainability: This is where the deep challenge will be. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
