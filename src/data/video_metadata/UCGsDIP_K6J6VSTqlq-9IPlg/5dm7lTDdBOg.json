 "date": "2019-12-30",
 "description": "Bret Weinstein and Sam Harris had a great conversation. It was nearly four hours where they touched on Sam's latest book, Bret's questions about Sam's take on Free Will and finally on the Bret's Metaphorical Truth and Sam's take on Religion. I'll get into this last topic in upcoming videos. \n\nBret's attempt to work on Sam's free will analysis never really got anywhere sort of like how Jordan Peterson never got anywhere with Sam on Religion. Why? Wilfrid Sellars (here explained by Daniel Bonevac) explains the two visions of the Manifest Image and the Scientific Image. Sam, sort of like a pirate with an eye patch keeps switching them back and forth. Bret (like most) is trying to integrate them. They never get far with it for this reason. \n\nSam Harris on Bret Weinstein's Podcast https://youtu.be/id6AqKIxd94\nSam Harris' book Lying https://amzn.to/2ZGyjkb\nPhilosophy Now review of Sam Harris' book https://philosophynow.org/issues/110/Lying_by_Sam_Harris\nDaniel Bonevac on Wilfrid Sellars https://youtu.be/aVoWTnpF5ew\nDavid Bentley Hart on Daniel Dennett's Book https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-illusionist\nAnthony Flood on Alfred North Whitehead on Reason and purpose http://www.anthonyflood.com/whiteheadreason.htm\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
