 "description": "Jonathan Pageau and Kanye West believe in the vision of the Medieval Village. West has the money and power to pursue it in his errand into the wilderness. Both seek to address what Julian and Nick see as our contemporary rootlessness. Even a \"gender abolitionist\" like Vaush concedes the beauty of the commitment expressed in the tradition marriage. Tom Holland notes the astounding accomplishment of the Gospel authors who somehow flipped the script on humanity's self-centeredness to portray Jesus the victim as the lover we've been longing for. It forces us into a choice. Be a selfish hypocrite who demands to be sacrificially loved by unwilling to love in that way, or give way to the Darwinian vision of one's life at the expense of even our loved ones. \n\nJulian and Nick on the Randos Channel. https://youtu.be/xrvm2HkS1jg\nJonathan Pageau and Jordan Greenhall on Rebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/TU_ny1ClpKI\nKanye West on Apple's Beats 1 https://youtu.be/QuOCvKvrwI8\nSteven Pinker with Jordan Peterson https://youtu.be/pBylbB7s5Nw\nModern Day Debate Vaush vs. PVK https://youtu.be/LAUgExXyez4\nWestern Secularism is Christianity Lite https://youtu.be/3WuGxM2uoNo\nUnbelievable Weinstein and McGrath https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nBret Weinstein New Religion https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nThe Alchemy of Air https://amzn.to/2N5Q7AJ\nFertilizer Runoff https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/climate/nitrogen-fertilizers-climate-change-pollution-waterways-global-warming.html\nJordan Peterson and Sam Harris Vancouver 1 https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\nTom Holland on Delingpod 35 https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nJohn Vervaeke Essences https://youtu.be/Yp6F80Nx0lc\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2C1cqRB\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
