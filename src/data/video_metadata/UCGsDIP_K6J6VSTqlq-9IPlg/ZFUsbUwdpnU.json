We're only half way into it so I think this will continue for a bit. What's at play is the continued role that neo-evangelicalism plays on the American church scene, in American political culture and in the culture overall. I'll be diving into this podcast fairly thoroughly but in order to do so we should get a handle on what neo-evangelicalism is via its roots with the origins of Christianity Today, who is producing the podcast. \n\nRise and Fall of Mars Hill https://pca.st/zampiecn\nThe Apostles of Reason https://amzn.to/3j6KHpc\nFundamentalism and American Culture https://amzn.to/3j5klDT\nThe Age of Paradise https://amzn.to/3BdA3Dl\nDavid French Why Masculine Ministry Rise and Fell https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/why-a-masculine-ministry-rose-and\nLiam Thatcher: The Un-Intended Consequences of Failure Porn https://liamthatcher.com/2021/08/20/unintended-consequences-of-failure-porn/\nhttps://paulvanderklay.me/2021/08/08/rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill-podcast-commentary/\n\nDiscord link.
