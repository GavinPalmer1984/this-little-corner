Freddie declared that it was God's will that my plans changed so that I could help him out. I'm not sure how I feel about the maker of the universe arranging my schedule according to Freddie's needs but I'll resign myself to my station. This is regular mid-week so with some chitter chat and Freddie was happy we could use the church sound system to lay down a beat so he could do a rap. We recorded a song for Freddie's channel too.
