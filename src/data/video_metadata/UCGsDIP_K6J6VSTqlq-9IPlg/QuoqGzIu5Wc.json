 "description": "Sam reached out to me with his interesting case study. In the meaning conversations I've been pondering the place and value of propositional belief over and against lived out belief. The Trinity is deeply foundational to orthodox Christianity but do even conservative churches today have a felt sense of how it functions in the life of the church? Sam's case illustrates that question. \n\nAthansian Creed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discordapp.com/invite/pmQuHSW (Discord Server) (this updates every 100 users so look for the most recent videos if this link doesn't work. \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nThere is a video version of this podcast on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/paulvanderklay\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nBlockchain backup on Lbry https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
