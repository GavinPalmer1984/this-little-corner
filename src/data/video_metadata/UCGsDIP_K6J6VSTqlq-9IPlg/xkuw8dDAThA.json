 "description": "Bret and Eric Weinstein have been on a mission to save the world. As we've seen in the last two videos they want to save humanity which is itself the cause of our crisis. After the Cold War Francis Fukuyama imagined that from then on out it would be Democratic capitalism that brought in the eschaton, but no such luck. The Intellectual Dark Web, or what's left of it after the recession of the first Jordan Peterson wave is trying to have a religious conversation while trying to avoid religion and it isn't working. Religion is the longest continuous conversation on the planet. What might the prophet Isaiah have to say in this? A lot. \n\nWeinstein and Schmachtenberger Grope towards Eschatology https://youtu.be/EsvG3zbKGa4\nWeinstein and Schmachtenberger Search for Fullness Beyond Status and Pleasure https://youtu.be/4bzwv7mzzCc\n\nPortal 27 https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kast-media-2/the-portal-2/e/68383234\n\nGK Chesterton Heretics https://amzn.to/3aNvmTG\n\nMcGrath and Bret Weinstein Unbelievable https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\n\nRod Dreher Pilgrims vs Tourists https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/pilgrims-vs-tourists-zygmunt-bauman/\n\nChristine Hayes and the Metadivine Realm https://youtu.be/wRPqtGywkCw\n\nRoss Douthat Decadent Society https://amzn.to/3aUytJL\n\nGod #1 and #2 \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12aGC_PjUWIDegMKZ1UYOwB4XTja90CTkO8lR2UBUsCM\n\nKate Bowler on Twitter https://twitter.com/KatecBowler/status/1247545818992857091\nNYTimes piece https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/kate-bowler-cancer-coronavirus.html\nNathan Pyle https://twitter.com/nathanwpyle\nGlen Scrivener and Tom Holland https://youtu.be/a0xCs2EfiXA\nJordan Peterson Choose Your Sacrifice https://youtu.be/ZjI7vqizTRc\nDeath https://youtu.be/_m3f79PvBXU\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
