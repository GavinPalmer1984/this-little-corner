 "description": "Why are people who listen to Peterson interested in the Bible and Christianity? Part of the reason is that he's deconstructing facile critics of the Bible and religion like Freud and Marx. \n\nGoing old school with the Biblical Series Commentary. This time on Bib Ser 4 https://youtu.be/Ifi5KkXig3s \n\nNo fancy this time, just watching through and commenting on what I've learned so far from Peterson.",
