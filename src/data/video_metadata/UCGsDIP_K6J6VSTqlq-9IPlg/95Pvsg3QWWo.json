 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95Pvsg3QWWo",
 "date": "2019-09-20",
 "description": "I did a \"ThinkClub debate\" with Adam and he felt I straw-manned Bret Weinstein in my last video. How IDW unbecoming! So I wanted to go deeper into the challenges I see with what I perceive as Bret Weinstein's naturalism. There seems to be a new dawning among Naturalists that religion is the only competent vehicle that could grapple with the challenges (environmental, social, political, etc.) that we fear will destroy life on this planet. What would such a new religion require? Does naturalism have what it takes to satisfy those religious requirements? \n\nMy video on Bret Weinstein's proposal as a new religion. https://youtu.be/ymKC3b83sqo\nMy ThinkClub debate with Adam https://youtu.be/6bZhJ8lMjT4\nUnbelievable with Bret Weinstein Pt. 1 https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nUnbelievable with Bret Weinstein Pt.2 https://youtu.be/Bbw1xjxfL38\nJeff Q Looks for a Spiritual Solution https://youtu.be/yDOqQv6wUg8\nVervaeke Awakening from the Meaning Crisis https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\nMary Kochan is Vervaeke trying to destroy religion https://youtu.be/W3r8Z9y5UIc\nDurkheim on Religion http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Durkheim2.htm\nThe Metaphysical Club https://amzn.to/30dgFZ4\nCS Lewis Miracles https://amzn.to/30ezQ3F\nBret on Dax Shepherd Podcast https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/bret-weinstein\nA Quality Existence with Vervaeke https://youtu.be/8d2vlpieEH8\nBrave New World https://amzn.to/2LGmvJo\nThe Matrix Movie https://amzn.to/34XY7dM\nWas Calvin a Calvinist?
