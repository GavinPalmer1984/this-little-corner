 "description": "Rob's been willing to be on some of my round table discussions but he recently launched a YouTube channel with a conversation with a friendly skeptic so I asked him to come on for a larger conversation. His upbringing might be strange to many of you but it is oliebollen plain for a CRC kid. He has written a book about sex, which is interesting (both sex itself and the book) and towards the end we talk a bit about how the Jordan Peterson moment changed some of my life. Here is our conversation. \n\nRob's Church website https://www.sunnyslope.org/\nRob's chat with a skeptic friend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18eMuSUQZxI&t=363s\nRob's book on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Unashamed-Exploring-Transforms-Intimacy/dp/1937063690/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
