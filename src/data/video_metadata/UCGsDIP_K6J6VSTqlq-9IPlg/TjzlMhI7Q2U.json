Studied at Oxford, top tier athlete, third world development experience, but also survived a near fatal illness that completely disrupted his plans. Now as a researcher in communication and bioethics. We touch on the Jordan Peterson/Harris debates, Vervaeke's work and much more. \n\nHe wanted me to apologize for depending on wifi for his Internet connection. In our next talk he'll use Ethernet. :)  \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discordapp.com/invite/pmQuHSW (Discord Server) (this updates every 100 users so
