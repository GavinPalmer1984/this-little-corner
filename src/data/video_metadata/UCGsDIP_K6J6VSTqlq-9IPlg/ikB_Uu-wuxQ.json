 "description": "Bret Weinstein has been tweeting lately about God, Christianity and humanity's future. He offered his anthropology on an Unbelievable conversation with Alister McGrath saying that people are the products of Darwinian processes of genetic evolution and cultural evolution. I agree. He complains that Richard Dawkins didn't take his meme idea far enough. I don't think Bret takes his cultural evolutionary process far enough to fully appreciate the role of religion in bringing humanity where it is today. I don't think Bret's anthropology is far from the one laid out in Genesis 2 where God makes the man from the dust of the earth and with divine breath breathes life into us. We are a combination of culture/story verse and planet earth. \n\nBret and Alister McGrath on Unbelievable https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nYuval Harari Sapiens https://amzn.to/37Jbj7Z\nJordan Peterson 12 Rules for Life https://amzn.to/2OOiHGf\nAnother Miss Oh https://amzn.to/2XRuBDq\nMaps of Meaning https://amzn.to/34lxzCF\nBlack Earth by Timothy Snyder https://amzn.to/2DmK2dn\nJonathan Haidt Happiness Hypothesis https://amzn.to/2KVQCvt\nJoe Rogan and Richard Dawkins https://youtu.be/_bN4spt3744\nJordan Peterson and Matt Dillahunty https://youtu.be/FmH7JUeVQb8\nJordan Peterson and Tim Lott https://youtu.be/RIB05YeMiW8\nMIroslav Volf Exclusion and Embrace https://amzn.to/37JcSmn\nThe Ideas of Rene Girard https://amzn.to/33oKxhC\nDominion by Tom Holland https://amzn.to/2XQoJdE\nJohn Vervaeke and JP Marceau Metaphysics https://youtu.be/DWg8-VxnOog\nDaniel Bonevac Manifest Image Scientific Image Wilfred Sellars https://youtu.be/aVoWTnpF5ew\nJames KA Smith on Rebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/AoCJXjJQwVo\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
