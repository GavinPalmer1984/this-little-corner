mother or know where they lived\nPartner got a government house to get out and smoke drugs\nFell in with a crowd taking drugs\nNot working, getting into drug dealing, harder drugs\nNO one lives in the moment like a heroin addict living in the streets\nAt 27 in jail\nNed Kelly, bush-ranger outlaw, folklore hero\nGrandma was a Roman Catholic, Uncle like a father figure, shamanic anti-Christian\nBeat poets, Hunter S Thompson\nAfter jail tried to limit his drug consumption\nCouch surfing\nPartner had found Christ\nFriend Ian\nPeople in that lifestyle don\u2019t know that you can live differently\nIan read philosophy\nFriendship\nCommunity College\nApprenticeship\nGot clean, methadone\nStage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nWent into ICU, wasn't going to live\nCancer was a walk in the park compared to getting off heroin\nSupport from a catholic charity\nHad to get on opiates to fight cancer\nHad to get back on methadone\nWould have to take 3 months off\nSave up enough money and holidays to take 3 months off\nWork caulking\nLooking into Christianity because of the Jordan Peterson bible lectures\nTold he couldn't have kids\nStarted going to church\nStarted to pray\n\nFor the audio
