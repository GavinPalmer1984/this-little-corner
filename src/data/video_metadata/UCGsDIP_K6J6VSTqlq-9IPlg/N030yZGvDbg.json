We struggle with forum for deep open ended public conversation in our culture and perhaps YouTube is filling that void. Our conversation ranged over a number of topics including TS Eliot and modernity. I've already used a clip out of this conversation and I'll likely keep doing so. \n\nNotes \nConversations\nAudio learning youtube tape\nDeconstructing JBP\nWhy we could hear the bible freshly from JBP\nMythology and endurance of civilization\nTS Eliot the four quartets, biographies\nJeremy irons reads TS Eliot\nAtheists said the vision\nAll other groups say \u201che\u2019s our guy\u201d\nPlurality\nVervaeke\nMeaning crisis\nAtheists trying to promote their totalizing vision and when JBP attacks a multitude unify under him (except the SJW) \n\n#jordanpeterson #meaningcrisis
