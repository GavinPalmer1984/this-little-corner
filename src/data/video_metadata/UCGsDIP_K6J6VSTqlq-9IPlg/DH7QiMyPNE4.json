In some ways that conversation was even more interesting than the large event. I'll do a deep dive into that video but before that we need to look how in Scott Adam's metaphor we are watching two movies in one thing. We'll also bring in some James KA Smith on Cultural Liturgies as well as comments from Rod Dreher's blog. \n\nOne Last Question https://youtu.be/afSQZweYDts\nJohn Vervaeke Meaning Crisis Episode 11
