They met Job (because they're all Dutch) and he came along for the conversation. \n\nWe got into Jordan Peterson, John Vervaeke, Jonathan Pageau, Job's recent decision to fully convert by taking the Eucharist at his church, both Aron's and Bas' faith stories.\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
