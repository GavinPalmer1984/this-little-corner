 "description": "Jess is back for another chat. Estuary talk ignited his imagination because of his story. We've spoken before links below. We go deep into what churches get wrong and why estuaries could help churches with their mission of blessing the world. \n\n\n\nNotes. \n\nWhat are reasons the church should get onboard with something like this\n\nFramed it in evangelism terms\n\nDeconstruction phase\n\nParents got saved when he was 8, parents started doing missions work with YWAM\n\nGetting crowds so that someone can preach to them\n\nAll non-denominational, very evangelical flavor, \n\nBible centered, spirit led active Christian ministry\n\nEstuary\n\nCame to a breaking point where God wasn't telling me what to do\n\n\"Tell me what to do God!\"\n\nFirst step of a cascade down to deconstruction valley, early 2000s, he's 40 years old now\n\nSo much emphasis about certainty of belief and holding on to faith no matter what. Suppress all doubts to try to steal any certainty you have about faith. \n\nWhen he was deconstruction he felt like God sort of let him go. There was a specific moment. \n\nIn a way God was letting me go. \n\nI wasn't going to have the security I was going to have by Him telling him what to do. \n\nThat was the moment when God kind of like let him go. \n\nFollowed the postmodern stuff that was going on. \n\nFound Peter Rollins. Peter Rollins as the ferryman that got him across the marshlands.\n\nHe's a theist of some kind. Held onto just God and everything else could go if it needed to. \n\nMarried and three boys. \n\nOutside he's going to church. All of this is internal\n\nHaving to deal with these issues on online spaces. Not a lot of people face to face to talk with. \n\nTrying to get into Biologos, trying to bridge that divide\n\nRight when social justice is getting stirred up. It was a part of the conversation since he was a teenager. \n\nYWAM missiology trying not to transmit culture with the gospel\n\nGet down to the core of the gospel without the American nationalist trapping and the colonialist trappings\u2026\n\nWas Paul's additions to the New Testament actually good. Maybe we just need to stick with the gospel. Get to the historical Jesus. What if there's no hell? Why do we have this doctrine? \n\nRob Bell, going down the path with the Liturgists. \n\nPeter Rollins ferries me across. Then I have to find something. \n\nFew years before he ran into JBP. JBP melded the scientific and religious. \n\nI had two worlds in my head and JBP melded them. \n\nJonathan Pageau\n\nDeconstructing Christian materialism\n\nSimilar to how YWAM operates. Started out of the Jesus movement by Loren Cunningham\n\nStarted buying property to run schools to listen to God and go do what he says. \n\nThey would raise up leaders and they would send them out. \n\nBuy up a property and start their own YWAM base. \n\nSome bases will get cult like\n\nCaught more than taught\n\nThe U-shaped journey is inevitable\n\nPeople who haven't taken the post-modern dump yet\n\nDon't think alone\n\nThe U Shaped Story\n\nHow do you start one now? \n\n\n\nMy first talk with Jess where he tells his story. https://youtu.be/SNfv51SVB0k\n\n\nMy conversations with Jess in a playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSXopxC8Z9vxoSXlLYP1bTq5Sf0zt6nJ",
