 "description": "With the 20th anniversary of 9/11 we're awash in retrospectives that immerse many of us in all the feelings of that day. What is going on? We are in the midst of spiritual conflicts but to simply imagine or reject them as purely other-worldly or supernatural is not paying attention to what we do and how we behave. \n\n@Chris Williamson interview with Luke Burgis https://youtu.be/72svGiOaKMk\nClips from \"Hitman Hart: Wrestling with the Shadows\" https://youtu.be/L3wZhA5s3kI\nEveryone Losing Their Minds https://youtu.be/xuTKVqWRmCw\nTom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook The Rest is History 9/11 https://pca.st/jdl26sbr\nThe Godfather Opening Scene https://youtu.be/K6LKszIrDzo\nPeter Boghossian Resignation Letter on Bari Weiss Substack https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/my-university-sacrificed-ideas-for\nHigh on God High on God High on God https://amzn.to/38MCnF6\nSun Tzu Art of War https://amzn.to/38XdhDx\nAaron Rodgers Danica Patrick https://www.nickiswift.com/227408/the-real-reason-aaron-rodgers-and-danica-patrick-broke-up/\n @Jonathan Pageau  with @Jordan B Peterson Conversation https://youtu.be/2rAqVmZwqZM\n\nDiscord link.
