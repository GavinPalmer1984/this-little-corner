Why such a long theoretical introduction about the relationship between consciousness and what we call reality? Is the first question we must answer whether God is a product of our minds or if we are a product of His? Why does Peterson believe that the Bible expresses a consciousness smarter than what any of us possess or even what our age possesses? Which finally prevails, the physical layer of existence or the story layer? \n\nHere is the video I am commenting on. I only talk about the first 5 minutes of it. https://youtu.be/hdrLQ7DpiWs \n\nHere is the Joe Rogan experience video I refer to. https://youtu.be/6G59zsjM2UI \n\nAnd I introduce the Jordan B Peterson
