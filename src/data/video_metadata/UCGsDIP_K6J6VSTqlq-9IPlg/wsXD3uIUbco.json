 "description": "We continue to play around with formats on the Bridges of Meaning Discord. This is a panel discussion relating to the homeless crisis. Jacob works in insurance and deals with this crisis from that perspective. Kalepa has been homeless and then worked at a YWAM compound in Hawaii dealing with the homeless there. Richard went to Seminary and saw those students deal with it from their perspective. We spend the first hour and a half talking among the 4 of us and then we open it up to the rest of the group.
