 "description": "Marten lands a randos slot and our conversation traverses far and wide. \n24 years old, University of Groningen\nBachelors in classics, major interest in ancient history\n\nMasters in theology and religion, masters in early Christianity\n\nMontanism\n\nApplied to the research masters and was accepted\n\nHopefully find a use for it\n\nVery difficult to find a decent career in this stuff. \n\nPhD if I find any interesting internships later on in the program\n\nThe most rural part of Friesland\n\nBret Weinstein\n\nDouglas Murray\n\nRural vs urban\n\nPermanence of occupation\n\nPentecostal are people who believe in miracles\n\nAt the age of 8 had an intensive meaning crisis. Finitude and Infinitude, one way or the other and both were quite terrifying. \n\nEvangelical church occupied with apocalyptic thinking\n\nAt a young age afflicted with these crisis? Why isn't the rest of the world making a big deal out of these crisis\n\nLiving in an entirely different world from the other people about him\n\nAutism, all along\n\nWatching apocalyptic movies, different from Lord of the Rings\n\nPrimary school very popular and very social, sensitivity for authority. \n\nAppreciated authority and eager to submit to it. \n\nEspecially in hindsight that was exceptional. \n\nThere were two kinds of Reformed not getting along, tensions became too hot, things not going well. Exodus of some to another school. \n\nSet his world upside down. Able to get along with almost anyone. \n\nParents became associated with more Charismatic types. \n\nCharismatic renewal. Made quite an impact on him. See miracles. Is this supposed to be normal? \n\nRigoristic things like fasting, piety, \n\nSense of authority damaged. \n\nDistinction between reverence due to people of authority and what he thought of the persons themselves. \n\nTransition to secondary education, not as seriously Christian. Very secularized. Not pietistic. \n\nFound it very difficult to take church seriously. Very very very religious in his own right. Not able to find anything solid in the Evangelical church. No room to develop himself. Due to the fact that his Bible knowledge was beyond his peers. \n\nNames and facts about the Bible. Very lengthy sentences to write over from the book. \n\nFelt like a pariah. Didn't feel like I had a home. Wander for quite some years in that regard. \n\nBouts of the meaning crisis, panic attacks over social situations, declined over 2 or 3 years\n\nDidn't effect personal devotion. \n\nResentment crept in and he knew about it. Festering in the corner. \n\nBegan praying to God for humility. Wasn't involved in church. Deeply within Frisian culture. \n\nAre you still going to church. Rock music made by Christians. Switchfoot. Reliant K, House of Heroes. Falling Up\n\nJust looking for God in almost any media, any book. Came into contact with Socrates. Love with classical languages began. Contributed to the reason he still believes. \n\nUncertainty, darkness, Voth, Sally, doubts, back of your mind, \n\nDon\u2019t want to sow seeds of doubt and fear. \n\nWhy do I believe. He's pre-modern. Living in an enchanted world, \n\nYou're arguments might be right but you don't speak with authority.\n\nVery apprehensive of sophism. \n\nRhetoric, Cicero and Augustine. \n\nRhetorical argument and the aesthetical argument. Reading Latin and Greek conveys rational and aesthetic knowledge. Middle voice. \n\nPascal idea. Always enough light, always enough shadow. \n\nFrisian charismatic, classics, meaning crisis, \n\nArgument of simplicity: embodied by Socrates\n\nCalvinist root of self-examination. \n\nKnown unknows and unknown unknowns. Master of knowing what I do not know a lot. \n\nPeterson's combination with the dragon of chaos: Socrates, Augustine, Calvin, Nietzsche: Abyss, \n\nHumanist side of Calvin. Overlap between Calvin, Nietzsche and Peterson\n\nThis is not like propaganda. \n\nAugustine has this commentary on Psalm 41: Deep unto deep, abyss unto abyss\n\nCompares to God and people as abysses. \n\nSpeaking into the void. \n\nTake these elements and synthesize them. \n\nLord Huron: how they speak about the void. Is Calvin speaking here? Is JBP speaking here? Am an bsing myself\u2026\n\nThe Discarded Image. \n\nNature gives most of her evidence to the questions we ask her\n\nRationality. We are not rational, but we participate in, or inhabit rationality. Stay in my logos if you want to believe. \n\nRetranslate Logos\n\nRatio. \nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/",
