 "description": "Justin Brierley was on Adam's Think Club channel. I thought it was a good conversation but when Justin said that \"reality was centered upon a person called Jesus Christ\" I wondered how that would sound to Adam and to other atheist. It's easy for Christians to talk in their church code. I do it too. I wanted to go into this language a bit. At the end of the interview Justin I thought laid out what he meant. \n\nJustin Brierley on ThinkClub https://youtu.be/IyXF23WLILU\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
