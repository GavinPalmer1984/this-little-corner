 "description": "Jeff and I have been corresponding for a while now. He's from Grand Rapids MI but didn't grow up Dutch Calvinist. He has followed the Jordan Peterson developments but is skeptical that Christianity, or any ancient religion, can address the challenges we face today. This is, in many ways, the same objection that Bret Weinstein and others have raised. I of course disagree. I think Christianity is uniquely suited to address the challenges we face today. Now many might disagree even with how Jeff sees the challenges but I'd like to take this opportunity to in fact talk about what I think Christianity brings to the table. \n\nJeff's Medium page https://medium.com/@jeffreyquackenbush\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
