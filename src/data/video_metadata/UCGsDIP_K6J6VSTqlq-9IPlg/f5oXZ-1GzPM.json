I was gone for meetings today and so didn't get a chance to check it. I indeed neglected to include an additional 24 minutes. Sorry about that. Here is the whole video. \n\nI thought  @Jordan B Peterson  and Bari Weiss had a terrific conversation. https://youtu.be/tFTA9MJZ4KY. The both occupy the moderate left that has been exiled by the rise of weaponized critical theory and polarization. They're both compelling speakers. \n\nI seriously considered just diving into this 2 hour plus monster of a supposedly one question talk \"Why Bari Weiss left the New York Times?\" but it was simply too good and too massive. So I'm beginning with the most important thing to notice here. This is all about a religious transition. What is unseen is THAT it is a religious transition but both Weiss and Peterson are a bit hesitant to really call it such because of the nature of secularity which is really a Christendom fog. That fog affords a degree of lubrication because of pluralism but it is going away as purity forces demand a realm of light and darkness. \n\nSo this is just the beginning of my treatment of this excellent conversation. \nTom Holland The Rest is History Culture War https://pca.st/dljf8nbm\nRoss Douthat https://youtu.be/mfXXzeg5lDE\n\n#jordanbpeterson #bariweiss\n\nDiscord link.
