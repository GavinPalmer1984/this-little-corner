The Third Commandment", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQgsXClTuY4", "date": "2020-10-03", "description": "The Third Commandment is tougher to understand than some. The early English translation \"take the Lord's Name in vain\" really doesn't connect to the vernacular. Contemporary translations punt with \"misuse\" but says nothing about what proper use or misuse might be. So we get into it a bit both with the history of translations and the history of interpretation. \n\nhttps://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
