They have an unquestioned belief in democracy, free markets and sexual liberty. He's written a book on this subject which we discuss. He is an economist with a degree from Oxford University and lives and works in Sydney Australia. \n\nWestern Fundamentalism https://amzn.to/2X0a3K8\n\nGordon Menzies\n\nFather studied bomb shelters epidemiologist\n\nCentral Bank\n\nSydney, University of Technology\n\nOxford PhD\n\nDonald hay, Christian economist\n\nOxford Union\n\nDemocracy\nFree Market Liberalism\nSexual Freedom\n\nThree things uncritically\n\nWestern Fundamental\n\nThe conflict is because of vested interests. Bulverisms\n\nDifferent pre-suppositions. Not necessarily because of the bulverisms. \n\nRather than look at the surface of arguments \n\nThe Fundamentals, a testimony to the truth\n\nPropositional faith\n\nWhat foundations do you use. James Orr\u2019s pamphlet on Genesis\n\nStating a set of unprovable presuppositions and building something on top of it. \n\nCalling someone a fundamentalist is anti-religious prejudice. \n\nThe fallacy of the special problem. Choosing to pin it onto religious people when it\u2019s really a general problem. \n\nA yearning for freedom. \n\nEverybody builds their lives on unprovable things. \n\nTransfering the metaphor of economic freedom from relationships. \n\nEconomic freedom and sexual freedom. An aesthetic right marginalize everyone else. \n\nDemocracy is good at letting a small group of people oppressing a large group of people. \n\nGroups make better decisions than individuals. \n\nLarge number of buyers and sellers\n\nMarkets have nice properties about dealing with shortages and gluts\n\nLeave the prices to move around and respond to shortages and gluts. \n\nMindset that everything is a mutually advantageous trade. \n\nThis cost-benefit mindset, ruthless regard for your advantage, \n\nRegard people\u2019s preferences as a fixed thing\n\nIt\u2019s the market\u2019s job to meet those preferences\n\nJoint goods\n\nKnock-on effects. Petrol contributes to pollution, well understood, an externality\n\nEffects of markets onsocial situations, motivation crowding out. \n\nCommercial mindset walks into a situation it transforms it. \n\nMoral frame. Once a price was involved it was a babysitting tax. \n\nCommodification, not just knock-on effects, The people themselves are shrunk and de-personalized. \n\nOutcomes is a transferal of a market mentality into a sexual ethic. Wanting to use markets in every area society. \n\nGary Becker, Nobel Prize winning, how the economy effects people\u2019s ideas of marriage\n\nStephanie Coontz, 1950s particular high point in the status of marriage in the world. \n\nPeople were prepared to count their blessings. \n\nHuman kind of sinful. Don\u2019t like looking back to a golden age. \n\nWhether we\u2019ve got too far away from that. \n\nMost people don\u2019t plan on an accident, but they do plan on traffic jams. \n\nRelationships instability has moved from the accident category to the traffic jam category. \n\nRelationships to be stable enough. Rely on the relationship continuing. \n\nRelational environment so unstable. \n\nDoes democracy care about the weak\n\nPeople have fundamentally equal value. \n\nFixing up pollution in the world, breed everyone to be half the size and nobody eats meat. \n\nWho agrees with this being a compulsory policy. \n\nWhy are people more valuable than animals\n\nA religious answer, special dignity\nIt\u2019s an illusion. We\u2019re not an evolutionary bias\nWe are more valuable because of our greater capacities. \n\nAre people equal\n\nDemocracy holds onto that. \n\nJohn Stuart Mill: whatever you like up to the limit of harm. Very weak criteria\n\nNietzsche: The strong, the powerful, the beautiful, will restore greco-roman greatness to the West. Also the hard working. \n\nLImiting markets to a sphere\n\nWhat will stand in the way of the market? \n\nPeople only recognize evil on the fringe, like a centrifuge. They don\u2019t recognize it in the small, mundane amounts. People used evil much more freely after 9/11. \n\nThe danger of using WW2 is that we only recognize it in extreme forms and not in ourselves. \n\nChristians who are feeling marginalized in the secular world\nPeople who feel marginalized that their culture is looked down on. \nThey are bad at looking at their own presuppositions. \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
