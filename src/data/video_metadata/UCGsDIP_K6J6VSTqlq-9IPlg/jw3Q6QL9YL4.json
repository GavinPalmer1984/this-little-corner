 "description": "Israel didn't free herself from bondage in Egypt. God did so and he did so at the expense of the firstborn of Egypt and the blood of one year old lambs. God's demand of the first born would not end in Egypt but would be memorialized and paid over the years by thousands of innocent animals redeeming the firstborn of man and beast. This would continue until God himself would offer his own first born and the world would not be the same again. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
