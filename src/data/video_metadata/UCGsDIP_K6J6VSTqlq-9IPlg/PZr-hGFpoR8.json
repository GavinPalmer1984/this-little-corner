 "description": "When I think of how introducing Jordan B Peterson and Ibram X. Kendi into the same mental space I see sparks. I see two sides that would imagine such conversation would be pointless. But I think the DESIRE for it to NOT be pointless is expressing a very important thing. We WANT there to be hope of a space in which the two could find agreement, and change and a future. We WANT there to be hope. \n\nJordan Peterson with Coleman Hughes https://youtu.be/TFhynK0iZNE\nJordan Peterson Munk Debate https://youtu.be/ST6kj9OEYf0\nJordan Peterson Cathy Newman https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54\nJordan Peterson Slavoj Zizek https://youtu.be/qsHJ3LvUWTs\nAndrew Sullivan Tweet https://twitter.com/sullydish/status/1337060903762731009\nKendi how to be an antiracist https://amzn.to/3mhUkQg\nDaniel Bonevac the Problem of Normativity https://youtu.be/spBaumdWlgQ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
