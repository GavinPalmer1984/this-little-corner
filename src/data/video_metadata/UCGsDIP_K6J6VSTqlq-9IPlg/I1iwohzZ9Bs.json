bounded this way\nDescarte, a change in the theory of matter\nIt\u2019s primary characteristic is that it resists, it gives us experimentation\nFour E cognitive science\nThe project to deeply deconstruct the Cartesian dualism\nThe human phenomenon is misrepresented by these dualisms\nPerform as if dualism is true, perform in a continual cosmos, \nOther dualisms\n\nWhat is authority? \nFoucalt wisdom, technology of the self\nTriggers aspiration, afford aspiration\nA particular kind of flow\nHow do we do this process of aspiration? \nSerious play, take up a role that gets people into the anagoge that affords aspiration\nSeparation from the monastery to the university\nUniversity to the market\nWest had three locuses of authority\nThe church, the state and the market off against each other\nThe homogenization of power\nThe difference has progressively disappeared\nA stupefaction of power, power has lost the ability to self-correct\nThe elites are seen as less and less responsive\nBecause there aren\u2019t opponent processing among the powers\nSuch a turning on the elites\nThey\u2019re not good problem solvers anymore, yet they get more and more powerful and
