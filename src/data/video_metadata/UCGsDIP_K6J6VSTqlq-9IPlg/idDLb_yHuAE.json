 "description": "A friend texted me and said \"I've never seen @Jordan B Peterson  like this before.\" After I watched an hour of his conversation with @John Vervaeke  I knew he was right. \n#jordanbpeterson #johnvervaeke #no-filter\n\nThe conversation was entitled \"A Conversation So Intense it might be Psychedelic\" https://youtu.be/DLg2Q0daphE Well it made me more concerned with Jordan's health and wellbeing than anything else. I was very much looking forward to this conversation but now I don't know what to think, so when I don't know what to think I talk at you and hopefully with you and this is the beginning of this in terms of this conversation. \n\nJohn Vervaeke's Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/user/johnvervaeke\nJordan Peterson and John Vervaeke's conversation from 2015 https://youtu.be/-RCtSsxhb2Q\nBlue Church War in the Heavens Birthing Spirits into Estuaries https://youtu.be/a5YhaL38bC4\nAndrea with the Bangs and Justin Brierley https://youtu.be/YRYvAso1IN4\nMy conversations with John Vervaeke https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSXopxC8Z9toYgEughmm_IuYlFhLFxlX\nThe Internet of Beefs https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/\n@Rafe Kelley and @Jonathan Pageau https://youtu.be/koaLlK7qSDo\nAmusing Ourselves to Death https://amzn.to/2Ua0vNJ\nDiscord link.
