Philippino myth. \nGK Chesterton, Tradition is the democracy of the dead\n2 worlds for old in Tagalog. To be worn out, or to be a marker\nCat Stevens song and Tagalog song. The tagalog song is still very deferential \nRespect your elders\nBullying stories\nCorporations and rule\nThe job of a parent is to make himself useless as quickly as possible\nCrowdsource\nPeer review is an appeal to authority of your peers\nIf you want to take the edge of your modernity, pray to a saint\nI have done it and it works\nYou can fence your little sin. \nI\u2019m not praying to Billy Graham\nIt\u2019s no longer a community, it\u2019s an arms race\nCollege admissions scandal\nHalf a million young men who are simply disengaged in Japan\nFind something good at what you do\nYou have the burden of the world. \nLike a cross vs a container ship\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes
