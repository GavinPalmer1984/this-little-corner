The Bible doesn't have a lot of hagiography. We're not always sure what to make of Peter and Paul through the history of the church. One set of Christians gets a crowd going to try to have Paul killed. In the process, however, a world of particular questions gets answer with respect to the myriad of potentials that arise with respect to how people should live and what the nature of Christianity is. \n\nActs 15, 16 and 21.\n\nDiscord link.
