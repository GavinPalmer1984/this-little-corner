There will be a part 2 coming in a few days. You won't be dissatisfied. For those of you who don't know Topher he's sharp and articulate. Raised without an overt religion he's been navigating his elephant through the jungles of the Toronto meaning crisis. \n\nConvo notes: \nOne of four brothers, 3rd in the birth order\nLive in Toronto\n\nOne of the luckiest people on the planet. Canada, Toronto, Beaches, Family\n\nCanadian\n\nJoe Lars\n\nWhite collar to blue collar\nSheri \n\nLost world of the CRC\n\nPastors as Sherpa\n\nMovement back up and down up and down\n\nSquint method\n\nKnow how to listen to people and make and invalid move\n\nExploration \n\nElephant land\n\nDead reckoning\n\nHomo religiosis\n\nMy generation needs to figure it out what you need\n\nWhat are the intermediate options between the church and their moral matrix. \n\n\nConversation about morality, the real McCoy is church every week\nFor many people that's too large a step. They're not ready to get married. \nThere's a lack of a partial measure between church and nothing. \nFor the nones there is no explanation. This server is a version of that. \nSomething that isn't going to church ever week. We can wrap this format around our lives. \nIt gives and opportunity to do some of that. \n\nMaybe there's a need for a .5\n\nWhere outside of church \n\nGovernment is the wrong layer\nBetter layer is the Sunday dinner table\nSquished out middle\n\nFamily dinner style is squished out\nWhere are you having moral conversations in our lives\n\nBesides a moral orientation \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
