The possibility of a modern plague that kills our weak and elderly makes death a very real thing up close. How do we process this? David Brooks in his Opinion piece this week noted that pandemics often kill compassion. \n\nScarcity is a new thing for some of us. We hoard. We fear. We are ready to fight. Throughout history we survived by, as Abraham Lincoln said in his second inaugural \"wringing our bread from the sweat of other men's brows\". Certainly this is NOT what the Almighty had in mind according to Lincoln. \n\nJesus wades into the centuries long battle between Jews and Samaritans and brings peace ending with a town declaring him to be \"The Savior of the World.\" How does this happen? \n\nFor a far more indepth treatment of John 4 here are my Sunday School classes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS_9gLx08z7QW9dvx1k3qPtwpGQ2TP0wE\n\n\nTo see the final cut check it out on the church channel https://youtu.be/1qH52wjEp8o\n\n\n\u00a0Click here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
