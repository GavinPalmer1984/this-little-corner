In many settings it means getting to heaven when you die. The Bible doesn't reserve the word for this usage. Friendship with Jesus and living with Him in the new heavens and earth is how the Bible frames this. \n\nWhile the biblical lexical range does include the evangelical code-term like usage (Acts 4:12) the biblical usage reflects the broader salvation of God's creation rather than a gnosticized soul-only emphasis.\n\nHell comes up regularly as a question where I talk about this. Here is something brief I wrote in 2006.
