Gave up on faith and found it again partly by seeing and feeling loss. Found Jordan Peterson and me through him. We talk about faith, philosophy, Owen Barfield, reality, etc. \n\nNotes \n\nGrew up Pentecostal but a skeptical nature\n5 year old asking God to let me fly\nGood father growing up, he was in touch with something real\nSkepticism reasserted itself\nLoss of faith was disorienting\nNever found materialist view persuasive\nRead new atheists and evangelical apologists\nEverybody has an ax to grind\nShift was a lot of things collapsing\nBroke up with girlfriend, lost job, being overcome with emotion\nDavid foster wallace everybody worships, if you don\u2019t choose it you will still worship\nIn the middle of the pain there was something really good coming out of it\nThere\u2019s got to be something out there\nThe idea was an idea of redemption\nIt felt real and vivid, overcome with a sense of beauty\nNew girlfriend, double dated with a new couple\nNew friend who was a christian listening to Mark Ruttland\nFriend was in a tragic accident, ended up paralyzed from the neck down\nStarted visiting him at the hospital\nStarted going to church again, not knowing what I believed\nKnew that God loved his friend\nStarted going to a small group with him\nAbout a year later found Jordan Peterson\nWas having emotional experiences but this gave a language\nMade me realize that the part of me that was smart and cynical had something to gain by its nihilism\nI\u2019m getting something from my nihilism\nDivine justice\nCalvinism\nOwen Barfield\nHumility of God. what does it cost god to create and redeem\nThe passion of God, the joy and the sorrow\nGratitude and wonder\nFor
