 "description": "Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris are on a quest for Objective value. Sam has a host of challenges to arrive there because of his philosophical system. Peterson is ahead of him. Lewis worked through everything they faced and was able to incorporate the Tao, mythos and Christianity while able to resist racial progressivism, material equality progressivism, and happiness equality progressivism. Lewis knows exactly what's wrong with Sam Harris' approach. \n\nVancouver 1 https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\nCS Lewis anthology https://www.amazon.com/Complete-C-Lewis-Signature-Classics/dp/0061208493\n\nThe Metaphysical Club https://www.amazon.com/Metaphysical-Club-Story-Ideas-America-ebook/dp/B000OI1AF2\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
