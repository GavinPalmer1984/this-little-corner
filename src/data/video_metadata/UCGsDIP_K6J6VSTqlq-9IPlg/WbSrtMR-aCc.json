 "description": "For over a hundred years there's been a rumor in the zeitgeist that Christianity's day has past. It is unscientific to believe in the miraculous so there is a duty to limit one's beliefs to the realm of the mundane and the common. While this is mostly true people trying to maintain status among others who hold this belief some Christians have continued to maintain their belief in the resurrection of Christ and this has led them to continue to embrace the historic forms of Christianity. \n\nAt the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 I take some time to do some reflection on why I still believe. \n1. The uniqueness of the Bible in human history\n2. The unique attractiveness of Jesus\n3. The strange paradox of the church\n4. The failure of atheist scientism of offer an ought to NOT believing. \n\nProgressive Post-Evangelical video https://youtu.be/nAsNwskEHHQ\nClarence Boomsma Why I still believe the gospel https://amzn.to/39vHwjR\nQuora on Bones https://www.quora.com/Do-bones-get-harder-as-they-are-hit\nSam Harris on Bret Weinstein's Dark Horse Podcast https://youtu.be/id6AqKIxd94\nTom Holland on Delingpod https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nCS Lewis the Screwtape Letters https://amzn.to/2SGh1Cp\nSam Harris and Bret Weinstein Free Will https://youtu.be/5dm7lTDdBOg\nCS Lewis the Last Battle https://amzn.to/2stN5yQ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
