 "description": "Jordan Peterson in his Biblical Series offered the standard hypothesis of the gradual progression between polytheism and monotheism. Through a process of assimilation Ancient Near Eastern peoples accumulated the attributes of various gods into one God which appeared in the story of Israel. Christine Hayes, an Old Testament scholar from Yale introduces Yehezkel Kaufmann's idea of the radical discontinuity between Israel's monotheism and paganism. Besides the Biblical and historical questions I'm interested in how this aligns with differences between Biblical theism and contemporary competing atheisms and non-theisms. \n\nChristine Hayes Yale Course https://youtu.be/wRPqtGywkCw\nThe Religion of Israel https://amzn.to/2s4Sps2\n\n Click here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
