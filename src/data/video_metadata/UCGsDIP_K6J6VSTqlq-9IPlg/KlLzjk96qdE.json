Can science talk about the Holy? 34a covered exactly what CS Lewis did in the first chapter of the Problem of Pain. People have a non-rational sense of the Holy and the Moral but they don't necessarily come together in religion. The Jews put them together and they come together in Jesus. In the Problem of Pain you get Lewis' rough draft of his famous trilemma. \n\nVervaeke 34 https://youtu.be/KoqibFwvQJ4\nVervaeke on Quality Existence https://youtu.be/8d2vlpieEH8\nVervaeke 33 https://youtu.be/_zkLevmQe90\nThe Problem of Pain https://amzn.to/2LmKv4a\nThe Problem of Pain Audio https://amzn.to/2N5z7vG\nThe Idea of the Holy https://amzn.to/2LnXwdz\nCS Lewis' List https://amzn.to/2A53ucS\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
