 "description": "Skip runs the Carl Jung Depth Psychology Channel which puts out more hours of content a week than I do. Almost from the beginning of starting my YouTube channel Skip has been talking about Jordan Peterson, my channel, Peterson's approach and my approach to many of the questions he's interested in. He's devoted a great deal of time studying the work of Carl Jung and has worked very hard at making the work of Jung available and accessible to others. I wanted to get a chance to hear his story before we got into any more detailed discussion and analysis of Jung's work. \n\nSkip's channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqv_8eLqnb4bxTV44QwvrQ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discordapp.com/invite/pmQuHSW (Discord Server) (this updates every 100 users so look for the most recent videos if this link doesn't work. \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
