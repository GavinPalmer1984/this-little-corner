 "description": "Andreas is usually first to my videos. He's been around the channel and Discord server community for a while now. He finally finds a slot to share his story. There have been so many like it. Great to hear another. \n\nRaised RC, went to Catholic school\nLost his faith in the usual way\nPlaying video games\nStumbled across the usual atheist arguments, made the decision he couldn't believe it anymore. Wasn't quite lived out so he didn't have any relationship to that. \nHis mother said \"you still believe you just don't know it\" \nPerfectly content living his life playing video games\nGot pushed by his mother to do something so started doing something in IT\nExpected of him to study and do something\nStudied linguistics\nWas doing a bachelor's degree until writing the thesis and he got blocked\nWorking at a storage facility\nSpent that time going to work, video games, weed\nListen to podcasts while he plays video games\nH3 podcast, 2 episodes with Jordan Peterson\nPsychology of people with high neuroticism. Perfectly described how he felt\nStarted talking about how to get better\nWhy is it bad to NOT live up to my potential. Just doing a job earning money\nIn doing his job he learned that he has value. People liked him. He did well. Did he want to be that chicken in a cage? \nWrestling with himself standing with his phone. Made the conscious decision to continue listening. \nWas in a different department at work where he could spend time listening to Peterson stuff at work. \nStarted listening to the Biblical series. Blew him away. \nWanted a Christian perspective on Jordan Peterson's biblical lectures. \nIs Jordan Peterson dangerous? \nPeterson idolatry phase\nCS Lewis\nCS Lewis got him back into really considering Christianity\nStarted to say \"yes\" to more things\nTo actively seek out more opportunities to get out of the house\nTaking singing lessons\nThe company was being shut down. The new existential crisis\nHad to find a job. \nFinish apprenticeship in IT but didn't do well in interviews\nWent on a year and a half\nWasn't fully back into the faith yet\nGoing to Mass at Christmas. It felt good. \nJoin a meetup about Christians and skeptics\nStarted watching a lot more Catholic stuff on Youtube. \nThe deciding moment was a woman, of course. \nThat was his other idol. Getting a girlfriend, a family\nOn the day after that had an interview\nAlso applied for a job at a care home for the elderly\nGot shut down and the next day got an interview really felt bad\nThe day after got the call, here's a door opening. \nTrial work day, around Easter, started going back to church regularly\nBack to church regularly. \nParents got the idea to apply at another home\nShould keep at it. \nChurch choir. \nLike minded people, affirmation\nBoth honest and kind\nReally built his relationship with his parents again\nMom kept reminding him of \"deliver us from evil\"\nCOVID\nNo music associated with this protest\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
