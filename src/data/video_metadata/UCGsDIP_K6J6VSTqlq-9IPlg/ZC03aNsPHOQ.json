 "description": "Karen shares some of her story. Structure the basement first. There's something about the individual that's important to the universe. Karen's Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgp_r6WlBwDSJrP43Mz07GQ\n\nNotes \nLove and suffering\nStructure the basement first before you come out with an idea\nHistory of evangelicalism since 1980 and politics\nThe music scene. Became a Christian in 1980\nBottom line first: there\u2019s something about the individual that\u2019s important in the way the universe is structured\nGod works with each individual in a unique way\nSuffering is a very individual thing\nYour suffering is unique and others can\u2019t understand \nIn 1988 as a missionary in Japan \nReading the Bible and stumbled upon Philippians 3:10\nKnow Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings\nBrother died in a plane crash, sort out things with the parents\u2026\nAfter 6 months of suffering, the only thing she could hold onto is that God is good\nScared to go through suffering like that again\n\nWas interested in politics in the late 1970s\nBought a farm out in the country, preppers in a way, hippies turned preppers\nPolitics and economics, thinking to make a difference\u2026\n1980 Stumbled into a church. In that church ran across Secular Humanism in Light of the Holy Scriptures by Homer Duncan\nTrying to understand Christianity. Old fashioned tent revival in Iowa\nCountry church that taught the gospel. 5 small towns around. \nHad been a Friend\u2019s church. Many denominational differences are peripheral to true meaning\nNew pastor had been a missionary to the Navajo, not a Friend\u2019s pastor but a remarkable human being. \nAlways focused on Jesus Christ as the way, the truth and the life. \nFull Gospel business men at a former night club\nAsked if she would run for State legislature in Iowa\nGot elected, served for two year, became controversial\nJoined the conservative element in the legislature. \nIssues that came up that were appalling, sex ed curriculum developed by Iowa State\nWhy are they taking the meaning out of sex\nRealized that political activity is not the solution\nESL, simplest conceptual language\nChinese guy working on quantum physics\nHusband comes out and says he\u2019s in love with another man\nThe other thing that got me through the suffering was the body of Christ.\nReal people with hearts and hands and feet who gathered around, listened, prayed, cared for me, sat with both my Mom and my Dad while they were dying, helped me go through their house and pack up and sell all their belongings and even drove a truck across country to help me move to California.\n\nAlso sorry I froze when you asked me what I meant by the gospel.  In the peace and quiet now, I would say that it is to tell the truth about the centrality of the Lord Jesus Christ who took upon Himself my sin and bore my penalty on the Cross as the perfect sacrifice so that He could clothe me with His righteousness.\n\nMother had cancer with 6 months to live\nFather began having organ failure\nAimes Fellowship Church 1983\nSuffering teaches us at a fundamental level that keeps us safe from falling into the paint pots\nJohn Stott quote: \u201cI could never myself believe in God if it were not for the Cross\u201d from the Cross of Christ\nEvery person suffers. \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay",
