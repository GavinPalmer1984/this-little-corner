Why does Jordan Peterson seek engagement with \"Celebrity Atheists\" who are often Materialists? What do these engagements accomplish? \n\nCelebrity Atheists like to assert that religion is a bad thing and should be done away with. Jordan Peterson sees it as establishing the metaphorical substrate for our civilization based on the Imago Dei or the Image of God. \n\nUnbelievable Video https://youtu.be/syP-OtdCIho \nDr. Melanie
