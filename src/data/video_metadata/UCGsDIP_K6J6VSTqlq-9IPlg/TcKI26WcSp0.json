 "description": "A commentary video by a Youtube channel Pinecreek on a video by Capturing Christianity with Alisa Childers. I had never heard of her but apparently she's got a following doing apologetics and this new career transition from singer came as a response to the rise of what has been called Progressive Evangelicalism. \n\nThe trickle of evangelical celebrity deconstructions is either viewed as a concern or a sign of continued changes in the community of the Christian church. Rachel Held Evans was in many ways a leading voice in that movement and the roots of that migration has been a subject of commentary on this channel. I sum up some of the history of that transition updating it with some of the elements I've been discussing recently. \n\nCapturing Christianity https://youtu.be/oQ6doQsSQLU\nPinecreek https://youtu.be/QcdsGIu1zU4\nJonathan Steingaard https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/entertainment/jonathan-steingard-atheist/index.html\nChurch history in plain language https://amzn.to/2XlQ8p2\nA Severe Mercy https://amzn.to/2Xm7Skl\nA History of Christianity in the Reformation Era https://www.audible.com/pd/The-History-of-Christianity-in-the-Reformation-Era-Audiobook/B00DCAPE1K\nTransubstantiation https://amzn.to/2TRhEsD\nFatal Discord https://amzn.to/36Mhg3T\nChristianity's Dangerous Idea https://amzn.to/3dnqbLv\nMark Noll History of Christianity in USA and Canada https://amzn.to/3djPrSQ\n1493 https://amzn.to/36KPtkn\nGuns Germs and Steel https://amzn.to/3eGrCor\nA Secular Age https://amzn.to/2yTGBfK\nThe Discarded Image https://amzn.to/3eyQnTJ\nPastor in a Secular Age https://amzn.to/3dmqztF\nThe Everlasting Man https://amzn.to/3eBp3UJ\nNassim Taleb Skin in the Game Talks at Google https://youtu.be/uv6KLbkvua8\nMouthy Buddha Sam Harris losing audience to Jordan Peterson https://youtu.be/iBSOTY1rTtg\nGreat and Holy War by Philip Jenkins https://amzn.to/3cqrGYa\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
