For me (Paul) the main reason is that it  is important for me to NOT leave my congregation this week. While we have no cases of actual illness in my congregation we have many members who are in that high risk category. We will need to make decision over the next few days about the next few weeks and it would be unfair to my leadership to take off on a trip right now. \n\nJob remains in Southern CA until he can get a flight back to the Netherlands. \n\nThank you all who offered to host us and the events. We're sorry we need to postpone.
