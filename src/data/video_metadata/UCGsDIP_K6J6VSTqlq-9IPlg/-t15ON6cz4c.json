 "description": "Jonathan Pageau had a great video on Alex Jones on Joe Rogan. You should watch it. When I saw it I immediately thought of John Vervaeke's treatment of shamanism. Alex Jones is a shaman and nicely illustrates the corruption of institutions and how institutions try to recover themselves either through chaos or control. We saw this in the struggle in the United Methodist Church this week over gay clergy. We sat it in the Roman Catholic priest scandal and Pope Francis' attempt to clean up the house. \n\nJonathan Pageau Alex Jones Symbolism https://youtu.be/b8BaY0e-VTQ \n\nAlex Jones on Joe Rogan https://youtu.be/-5yh2HcIlkU\n\nJohn Vervaeke Meaning Crisis Episode 2 https://youtu.be/aF9HeXg65AE\n\nJames Allison on Frederick Martel's book https://www.abc.net.au/religion/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-martel-and-the-structure-of-the-clerical-closet/10843678\n\nUMC Conference 2019 decision https://juicyecumenism.com/2019/02/27/2019-general-conference/\n\nAfricans won't trade votes for dollars https://juicyecumenism.com/2019/02/23/african-united-methodists-wont-trade-bible-for-dollars/\n\nAndrew Sullivan http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/andrew-sullivan-the-vaticans-corruption-has-been-exposed.html\n\nRod Dreher https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/inside-father-dinh-closet-vatican-catholicism-gay-priest/",
