Their stories aren't new. In fact they're almost predictable. Why? \n\nRhett and Link Lost Years https://youtu.be/hYCgz-MiNE4\nRhett and Link Missionary Years https://youtu.be/2_5PG-cl9WE\nRhett's Deconstruction https://youtu.be/1qbna6t1bzw\nLink's Deconstruction https://youtu.be/w1AZhlyoD9s\n\nOur understanding of what we mean by \"God\" and how it relates to this world have undergone a host of changes and even the church hasn't been tracking well with these. \n\nDr. Brett Salkeld is the Archdiocesan Theologian for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina Saskatchewan and the author of \"Transubstantiation: Theology, History and Christian Unity\". You might assume that this is simply a book about a historical theological dispute, and it is, but I think this book is a clear presentation of the history of the conflict surrounding our understanding of the word \"God\". We use the word \"God\" as if we know what we're talking about, or that we all mean the same thing when we say the word. I'm convinced we don't and I believe this conflict is at the heart of the great falling away of the church in the West. Brett and I get into this along with a lot of the issues I deal  with on this channel. \n\nBrett has a podcast https://archregina.sk.ca/thinkingfaith\nWebsite https://archregina.sk.ca/archdiocesan-theologian\n\nTransubstantiation book on Amazon https://amzn.to/2uZVqeA\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
