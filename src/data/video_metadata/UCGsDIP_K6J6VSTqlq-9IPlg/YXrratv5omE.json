 "description": "The world is too large and complex for our small minds to handle it so we pre-consciously reduce it to manageable meaning-impressions. We form biases in order to live and be productive in this too-complex world. A byproduct of this are preferences for people, cultures and customs we've found desirable and a fear of the undesirable. Racism is a common bi-product of this low resolution bias formation. It comes naturally to us and is best resisted by raising the resolution of our knowledge with people who are different from us with an active regard for loving the stranger up to and including the enemy. \n\nAgainst Murderism https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/\nScott Adams Systemic Racism Challenge https://youtu.be/bbJs4wXSvB4\nIt feels good to be a victim.
