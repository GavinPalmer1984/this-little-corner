Three weeks ago we asked about the secret of his success and we saw how he gave authority to his hapless disciples to cast out unclean spirits. This is deeply problematic for many secularists to understand but it is a highly symbolic, world-changing and powerful move that everyone in his day understood. Herod Antipas, in fact, understood it through his guilty terror over killing John the Baptist. This week the focus swings back to Jesus where he feeds 5000 men with five loaves and two fish. What does that story mean in this context? What point is the gospel writer trying to make that makes sense to us today? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
