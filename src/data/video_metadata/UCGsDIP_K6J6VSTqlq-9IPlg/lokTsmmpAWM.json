 "description": "This is the second of those videos I paused to post. I'm releasing them in reverse order. I very much see these videos as \"on the way\" in that my thinking is undeveloped. I'm trying to pull a narrative together. I begin with post-evangelical Trump obsession. Many evangelicals were defectors from the mainline. Now some of the children of fundamentalists are refugees in the Mainline but it won't be enough to save it. \n\nJulian Young writes about Nietzsche and Kierkegaard and has a fascinating interview from a few years ago where the guy making this series connects the meaning crisis and community. I end with Nathan Jacobs, Rod Dreher and Jordan Peterson which very much seems to be another offshoot branch of this development. \n\nHesitation video C: https://youtu.be/7LbCZ4_Wmkw\nVideo B https://youtu.be/lokTsmmpAWM\nVideo A https://youtu.be/nAsNwskEHHQ\n\nAlex Morris in Rolling Stone on Evangelicals and Donald Trump https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/christian-right-worships-donald-trump-915381/\nAaron Sorkin and Civil Religion on the Left https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/aaron-sorkin-donald-trump-president-letter-daughter\nDave Rubin and the renewal of civil religion on the right https://youtu.be/sZnyegR0pwM \nRachel Held Evans Monkeytown to Faith Unraveled https://amzn.to/2st1n2j\nDoubters in the Bible Belt https://thinkchristian.reframemedia.com/doubters-in-the-bible-belt\nRod Dreher Has the Last Episcopalian has been born? https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/last-episcopalian-been-born/\nCharles Colson Born Again https://amzn.to/2RYMAH6\nBizarro Twins of Mars Hill https://paulvanderklay.me/2012/05/18/the-emergent-bizarro-twins-of-mars-hill/\nRob Bell Super Soul Sunday https://youtu.be/DWq7k6CLe4w\nTripp on Jordan Peterson and Mark Driscoll https://youtu.be/P2Wh1pG0EH8\nStruggle to Read the Bible without Errors Numbers 31 https://mikeinsac.com/2019/09/02/my-struggle-to-believe-in-a-bible-without-errors/\nMouthy Buddha Sam Harris losing to Jordan Peterson https://youtu.be/iBSOTY1rTtg\nJulian Young https://youtu.be/B-62c5x4vvc\nRobert vA Conversation https://youtu.be/rJ32L_dlQiM\nDiscord Massive Unlisted Conversation https://youtu.be/iVuvoIUkYJY\nBecoming Nathan Jacobs https://youtu.be/zNJe9-JdJRs\nReaching Nones and Dones https://youtu.be/ME54BibXfYs\nLife Itself and the Unreliable Narrator https://youtu.be/-YLJb6p0nZA\nRod Dreher Tourists vs. Pilgrims https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/pilgrims-vs-tourists-zygmunt-bauman/\nJohn Crist Church Hunters 1 https://youtu.be/nT70cA-7qMk\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series 1 https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\nThe Bible Project https://www.youtube.com/user/jointhebibleproject",
