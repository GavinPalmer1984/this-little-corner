 "description": "I'm a pastor in a conservative Reformed denomination and I've been fascinated not just by Jordan Peterson's youtubes but by the response he's been getting. Why? Why do atheists listen to 2+ hours of him rambling on about the Bible? Why do conservative Christians listen to him when he assumes some beliefs they don't espouse? Why am I fascinated by him? I could have made a 2 hour video on this but I decided to keep it shorter. \n\nI pastor at Living Stones CRC in Sacramento CA http://livingstonescrc.org and I blog at http://leadingchurch.com",
