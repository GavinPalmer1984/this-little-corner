JP Marceau, Mary Kochan, and John Vervaeke had an amazing 2 hour conversation where they not only modeled effective, loving, productive, explorative conversation but they really did some work on drawing out the lines of difference between the religious and the post-religious dynamics of moral life. What a triumph!
