 "description": "See the timestamps below. Check out the new Youtube chaptering in the video slide. \n0:00 Pastor Word Gardener and how does that relate to the protests\n12:00 I listen to people as part of conversion. Am I ever direct? \n18:30 Increase in recognition of symbolism has increased the need of traditional Christianity, denominations. Movement towards older churches. \n24:45 Sacrament is something material that connects us to something immaterial. The experience of meaning functions sacramentally in Jordan Peterson's system\n27:30 What's the future of the IDW? \n31:45 Church Discipline and Divorce\n35:45 Roman Catholic churches aren't often strong on preaching. They are getting it from the Internet. Is this good? \n38:45 Where will the LGBTQ series end up? If I had one question to ask the other side. \n48:50 What do I do when I'm depressed, upset and feeling down about the things of the world? \n54:45 Uptick in people dealing with mental illness\n57:30 Orthodox christian whose favorite preacher is a Calvinist. Is this an example of an example of growing ecumenical openness? \n1:02:45 Rationalizations for evil things by turning towards religion. How do we know when we're doing that? \n1:08:15 Christianity is a great path to freedom, but I'm not a Christian. \n1:12:30 How do you become such a good listener? \n1:14:30 Ecumenical conversations Are we being forced into more ecumenical dialogue by atheism and secularization? \n1:18:30 Pastors have taken on a lot of the anti-racist religiosity since George Floyd. Bringing him to dive into Glenn Loury and John McWhorter for a broader perspective. \n1:27:45 Jordan Peterson. What is the immaterial thing that Jordan Peterson is using as the sacrament of meaning? \n1:32:00 Love your talk of spirits, principalities. Seems very Girardian, for whom the demon/unclean spirit is the particular mutual psychic possession one-of-another, and the Satan is the distributed, pervasive individual psychology. This moves Jesus's ministry from relevant to fringe demonic phenomena to an engagement with the psychological, sociological world on a most compelling manner. Do you have thoughts on the ontology of the spirits and powers? To me the psyche is existing, and the spirit is real, and has real life, even if it is psyche and dies if exercised from the possessed. Also, can you talk about both whiteness and whiteness studies as a principalities, and relate them to our perceptual lenses by which the world stands out to us and which organisms the objects if perception?\n1:43:50 What is my opinion on the Gnostic and Apocraphal books? \n1:46:50 What is my thought on authorship of Paul's letters and books of Peter as well. \n1:50:50 Jonathan Pageau, Systems theorists, Game B people. What's my take? \n1:54:00 What secular media has provide unexpected religious and spiritual insights? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
