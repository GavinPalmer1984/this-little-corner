Parents were both serving in a baptist church. Mom was a youth leader, father in children\u2019s ministry\r\n\nDescended into missionary poverty.

Kidnapped as a child, became a slave, lots of encounters with god in the wild. Loves his captors. Escapes. Learns theology. Becomes a missionary. \r\n\nPatrick offers something those communities embraced and desired. \r\n\nLoved the dedication of the monks. \r\n\nIrish missionaries found ways to properly bring in spiritual elements of the Celts. \r\n\nCatholics saw the benefit structure of some of it. Mutual confession. \r\n\nIrish monks did hair styles like the druids. \r\n\nMonasteries were a withdrawal from society. Abbeys were far more community oriented. \r\n\nBuild places for art, culture technology. When they\u2019d come into a community the community would value it. \r\n\nAlways this focus of work and prayer. \r\n\nA Christian movement that could work with the first nation\u2019s people of Ireland. Being good news for that community. \r\n\nBelieve, behave, belong.

Dementia cafe \r\n\nFilled the abbey with sacred art. Jesus sitting at the last supper. \r\n\n25 to 40 people who come for services, 1500 to 2000 people a week. \r\n\nWant the abbey to be a re-writing of a narrative. Plant an intentional community. \r\n\nPassage about God putting Ahab to death. \r\n\nCommon rule of life\r\n\nFour year lectionary based on the four gospels\r\n\nPhilosophy, culture making, art, city
