 "description": "Voth joined the Discord server not long ago. Came to this channel via Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Pageau. He's a rancher, a writer and a really good father of 6. He doesn't believe in God but he has a sense of what this world may do to his kids. He shares his story well and we talk about faith in God, the gift of faith and developing faith. \n\nCS Lewis Til We Have Faces https://amzn.to/2FxWQyT\nGod's Debris https://amzn.to/36GuvCf\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
