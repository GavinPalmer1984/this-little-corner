Eric Weinstein and Daniel Schmachtenberger (and I thought I had a long name...) had an amazing conversation about avoiding the end of the world. What is interesting (as it almost always is) is what they hold in common. Their visions of \"the good\" are deeply shaped by Christendom. \n\nIn many ways they are running parallel to Ross Douthat's Decadence book. Douthat is of course a committed Roman Catholic and he has a very interesting podcast conversation of his own. \n\nAll this points to the unfinished business of Christian theology which is eschatology. \n\nPortal 27 https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kast-media-2/the-portal-2/e/68383234\n\nthe Fifth Column Podcast http://wethefifth.com/episodes/172-the-fifth-column-podcast-sinking-in-the-swamp--tp4k9-n4pt4-6hmg5\n\nNeal Plantinga Not the Way It's Supposed to Be https://amzn.to/34eiUKm\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
