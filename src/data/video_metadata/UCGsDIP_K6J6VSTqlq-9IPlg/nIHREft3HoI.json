 "description": "What if the killing is a feature and not a bug of our fallen human nature? What if the Romanticism of our goodness is just an attempt to justify the pervasive violence of human history? The movie Ad Astra is the standard mythos of American religion. The movie Joker deconstructs it. If this is true of us, do we have hope for a future? Has the hope offered by the movie laden American religion always simply been a denial of death? \n\nPeter Thiel Eric Weinstein Portal 1 https://youtu.be/nM9f0W2KD5s\nBret Weinstein Fourth Frontier https://youtu.be/AIWlsSOubts\nCS Lewis on Living in an Atomic Age https://youtu.be/aLBV9qR0d5o\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series 1 https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\nRotten Tomatoes Joker https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_2019 \nRotten Tomatoes Ad Astra https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ad_astra\nThe King of Joker Driver https://youtu.be/PJIZSYcgi90\nComputing Forever Are We Being Played https://youtu.be/XzeWQBcjFiQ\nRationality Rules When Facts are Not Enough https://youtu.be/iviDRNPE6N8\nTodd Phillips Breaks Down the Opening Scene https://youtu.be/awoQuVq2yYc\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
