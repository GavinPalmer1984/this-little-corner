A lot of questions boil down to what do we mean by \"God\" and issues of availability to us as individuals and religious communities. \n\nTom Holland on Unherd https://youtu.be/Se98w2188oA\nJordan Peterson Sam Harris Bret Weinstein https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\nThe Rest is History Podcast https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-history/id1537788786\nBridges of Meaning Q/A Atheist Week https://youtu.be/aBXzNTIr0Vo\nWas Jordan Peterson's Responsibility Strategy Sufficient to Save Him? https://youtu.be/GIZ5OLDSdjw\nWith Nathan Jacobs https://youtu.be/zNJe9-JdJRs\nLydia McGrew https://youtu.be/12GhPSJpKq4\nFundamentalism and American Culture by George Marsden https://amzn.to/3rzM1C2\nJohn Suk https://youtu.be/R2MRBF5DUgs\nDallas Willard Nature of Worldviews https://youtu.be/X6hwsG7AUZ0\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
