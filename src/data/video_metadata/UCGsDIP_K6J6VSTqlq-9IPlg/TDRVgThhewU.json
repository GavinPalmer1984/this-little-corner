The Enlightenment split God into God #1 (the whole earth is full of his glory: impersonal, Mother of all structures, immanent) and God #2 (Holy Holy Holy, Father of all personhood, transcendent agent). Jordan Peterson against Sam Harris identifies what I call God #1 as being essential for human psychology after post-deism Darwin made God #1 am impersonal backdrop for diminishing human agency. \n\nVancouver 1 https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
