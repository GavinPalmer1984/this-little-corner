We get into the 4th cult he joined. A lot of fascinating observations about contemporary truth. \n\n#meaningcrisis #weirdfacebook #cults\n\nPlaylist of my convos with Nick. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSXopxC8Z9uLQXW8bJa-wsMYxNKb4CGX \n\nI'm not including more extensive conversation notes. \nCult 4: didn\u2019t start out as a cult, called a cult\nBorn into the meaning crisis\nWe couldn't contextualize the shift\nMillennials born into this cultural relativity as a starting point\nWe went from a game of truth to a gaslighting battle\nJbp and sh couldn\u2019t agree on what the game of truth was\nBattle of gaslighting, which one can colonize the other\nThe cult took that as the prime mode of action. \nInstead trying to convince someone by reason, by stronger distortion of reality has undermined their previous conception\nWhich worldview can hold onto its own internal logical truth the best \nCult\u2019s use of trolling as dominant mode of interaction\nJesus trolled, why did Jesus troll? \nVulnerability and honest were rewarded\nWeird facebook\nAlt-lit alternative literature 2014 morphs into weird facebook collapses 2017\nContext confusion\nPost-irony, can\u2019t tell what\u2019s ironic and what is sincere\nByrne reference\nDavid from Louisiana\nPageau\nHierarchy runs on credibility, global capital aspects of meritocracy , your ability to receive credit\nDownwards hierarchy is the social hierarchy, social as opposed to finance\u2026 the peaks are missing and the corners of the bases\u2026\nThe social hierarchy runs on authenticity, problem with authenticity, the effort to try to be authentic is the surest sign that you are not authentic, something along the lines of honesty\nIt\u2019s not post-truth it\u2019s pre-honest...\nWhat can colonize truth, it\u2019s honesty, keep the truth value and enhance it..\nThe integration of the observer: \nWe\u2019re moving closer towards honesty\n\nFor the audio podcast
