 "description": "This is the third/first of the hesitancy videos I made. Again, for me these videos are very much \"on the way\" in terms of figuring out how to talk about what is happening with post-evangelicalism.\n\nPost-evangelical progressivism is a collision between two worlds, the world many of these people were raised in with the assumptions about what the Bible is, and then the change in the culture. I don't think the Bible is quite what they think it is, nor are we. Here are a few disorganized thoughts about it. \n\nMikeinSac on the Bible https://mikeinsac.com/2019/09/02/my-struggle-to-believe-in-a-bible-without-errors/ \nMike's twitter account https://twitter.com/sacwriter\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series 1 https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\nTom Holland Delingpod https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nCultural Relativism http://home.sandiego.edu/~baber/gender/culturalrelativism.html\nModern Slavery https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/\nRoman Catholic Gay Judge Denied Communion Grand Rapids MI https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/30/us/gay-michigan-judge-communion/index.html\nAlex Morris Trump and Evangelicals https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/christian-right-worships-donald-trump-915381/\nChristian Smith Soul Searching https://amzn.to/2M1yelt\nKathy Keller Gender and Justice https://amzn.to/2PPPiMD\nStreams of Living Water Richard Foster https://amzn.to/2EnWH0f\nFulton Street Revival https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2007/september/fulton-street-revival-anniversary.html\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
