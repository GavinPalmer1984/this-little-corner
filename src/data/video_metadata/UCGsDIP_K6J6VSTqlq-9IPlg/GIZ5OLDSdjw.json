The difference between the unedited recorded interview and the written piece exposed the corruption of Western mass media journalism. Journalists David Fuller and Tim Lott detailed this beautifully in this @Rebel Wisdom  conversation, but deeper questions linger beyond the common cheap shots leveled by Peterson critics. \n\nMany of us did a deep diver into Peterson between 2016 and 2018. He was a revelation. We were, in some ways drawn to the miraculous. And then in June of 2019 it all fell apart. \n\nThe Peterson family chalks this up to a medical issue, but deep within the attraction of Jordan's crusade was an implicit transcendence of the physicalist boundaries. Can this reasoning really serve to frame his collapse? \n\nRebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/CIAM6ChUkdU\n\nJordan Peterson Times Unedited https://youtu.be/Fd2wKn6-X_A\n\nMy video on Jordan Peterson and \"The Office\" https://youtu.be/6gqoeqOxfO0 \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
