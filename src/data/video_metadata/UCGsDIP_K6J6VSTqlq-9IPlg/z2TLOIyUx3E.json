 "description": "Had some fun with the thumbnail. :) I\"m going to be walking through CS Lewis' The Abolition of Man as pertains to the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations. It's probably the best work of CS Lewis that pertains to the subject Peterson is pursuing in this effort. Most of the videos will be long, as usual, so here's just a short intro-teaser complete with clickbate thumbnail. I couldn't do lasers like Adam, so fire breathing had to suffice. \n\nVancouver 2 https://youtu.be/BtkwF5qA6uE\n\nhttps://www.audible.com/pd/The-Abolition-of-Man-The-Great-Divorce-Audiobook/B002V1NHYC \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Abolition-Man-C-S-Lewis-ebook/dp/B002BXH5RU\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
