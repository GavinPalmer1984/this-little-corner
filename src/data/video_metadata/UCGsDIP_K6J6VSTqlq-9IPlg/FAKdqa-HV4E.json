We followed that up with a conversation between David and myself. \n\nThe IDW came on the stage as a world-saving organization trying to rescue the West from decay. The movement has already decayed. Why? \n\nIf you want to look at world savers and world changes read history. The world is saved by the knitting together of people usually often in small groups and from those groups into bigger groups. It's a tiresome, thankless task but essential for any positive change. \n\nSevilla's Response video https://youtu.be/IlZZaXrVOEc\nDavid Fuller \"My Journey with the IDW\" https://youtu.be/zm2CNnhtx9A\nWhy is Youtube Boring Now https://youtu.be/6sRpXKBFrDc\nInternet of Beefs https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
