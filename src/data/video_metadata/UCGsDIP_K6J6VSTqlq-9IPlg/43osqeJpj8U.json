 "date": "2019-05-29",
 "description": "The Conference had breakout groups on the following topics. The groups met for about an hour to discuss their topics and these were the presentations given in the plenary session following. \n1. How might women respond to the Peterson Phenomenon? \n2. What challenges does the Peterson Phenomenon offer Christian theology and practice? \n3. Sniffing the Breeze. Clues for connecting Peterson, Ecclesiastes and Paul for connecting and correcting culture. \n4. Is God's grace and the Holy Spirit's presence missing from Jordan Peterson's scientific world view? \n5. Where does personal faith in Jesus as Lord fit into this discussion? \n6. How to use the media? What does the Peterson Phenomenon suggest for the future use of media for Christians? \n7. What are the limits of Jordan Peterson's position? Are his Darwinianism and his Taoism fatal flaws? \n#jordanpeterson #jordanpetersonphenomenon #jordanpetersonchristianity \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
