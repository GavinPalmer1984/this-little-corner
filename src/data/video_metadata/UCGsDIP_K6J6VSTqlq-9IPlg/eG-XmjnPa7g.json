If you're not enjoying the kind of life you see on commercials you're obviously doing it wrong. This is a lie. Most life gurus will offer technical fixes, but all technical fixes have a short shelf life. \n\nJames offers advice that leverages worldview assumptions. Patience, long-suffering borrows from future promise. Advent is when we learn to wait and suffer in hope. \n\nHow to have impossible conversations https://amzn.to/2LTXSJ2\nGottman https://amzn.to/2PIXaQ0\nCS Lewis the Great Divorce https://amzn.to/2LVcyrr\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
