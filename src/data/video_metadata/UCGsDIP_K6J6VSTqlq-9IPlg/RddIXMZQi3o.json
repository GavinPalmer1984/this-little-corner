 "description": "We've been exploring secular humanism's durability and staying power. In a conversation between Coleman Hughes and John McWhorter Hughes wonders whether their minority position on race can carry the day without the kind of religious power that Martin Luther King Jr.'s religious setting employed. People are acknowledged to be incurably religious. \n\nI pick up on this with an interesting lecture by John Gray on religious atheisms which focus on Auguste Comte and Ayn Rand. \n\nColeman Hughes and John McWhorter https://youtu.be/UPiNiTwf5bM\nJohn Gray lecture https://youtu.be/vkVau46LsHE\nJohn Gray interview 7 Types of Atheism https://youtu.be/bFzWtlGJXsY\n7 types of Atheism https://youtu.be/bFzWtlGJXsY\nCS Lewis Abolition of Man https://amzn.to/2GhLCyU\nAuguste Comte https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2vh2tzw\nAfter Skool Jordan Peterson Sacrifice https://youtu.be/ZjI7vqizTRc\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
