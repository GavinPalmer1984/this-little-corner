 "description": "The resurrection is often portrayed as a miraculous island in the middle of stagnant history. This is not how the Apostles saw it. The resurrection was a revelatory event that showed us the whole trajectory of our transformation in the middle of it. How it impacts morality is that we are admonished to begin living our destination now. \n\n1 Peter 1. \n\nLogos Made Flesh Conversation https://youtu.be/rAlmXRJt0u8\nLogos Made Flesh Arrival https://youtu.be/yCpUl7pFOBE\nArrival Trailer https://youtu.be/tFMo3UJ4B4g\nThe Secret of our Success https://amzn.to/3bDwGc5\nJesus as the Black Swan https://youtu.be/v1Xc8lYCrRw\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
