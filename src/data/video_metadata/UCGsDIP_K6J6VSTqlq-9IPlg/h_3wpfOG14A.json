 "description": "After I read the Federalist piece this morning I needed to say something. \"Gnostic\" has been an all-purpose slam used in house by Christians to label someone \"out of bounds\". I think that practice lowers the level of discourse and education within the church. It is a tremendously ironic complaint because of the common presence of low-resolution gnosticism among many simple church goers who believe that Christianity is about souls going to heaven for eternity after they die and few (besides NT Wright) seem to have much appetite for taking that on. \n\nSo, I'll talk about what historical gnosticism as an early church heresy, and how it is used in contemporary language in association with New Age spirituality and say that this really has little bearing to Jordan Peterson and his work. \n\nPhillip Carey's Audio Course https://www.audible.com/pd/Religion-Spirituality/Philosophy-and-Religion-in-the-West-Audiobook/B00DEQQO9I \n\nDavid Brooks The Road to Character https://www.amazon.com/Road-Character-David-Brooks-ebook/dp/B00LYXV61Y/ \n\nMy blog series on The Road to Character https://paulvanderklay.me/tag/the-road-to-character/",
