For ancients these would be our self, spirits, daemons, the gods or \"God\". They are both individual and communal. JBP tries to explain the science behind this to Sam. Is this Calvin's sensus divinitatus? \n\nThere was a problem with the first one I posted. Fixing it too longer than making it. There will be issues with video sync in some of the clips but it won't kill you. After I make a video I'm almost always dissatisfied with it which usually prompts me to make a new one but I'm out of video making time for this week (except for Rough Draft for Sunday tomorrow AM) so it will have to do. Feel free to rip it apart in the comment section. \n\nDublin talk https://youtu.be/ZZI-FwSQRn8 \nDaemon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(classical_mythology) \nJohn Calvin
