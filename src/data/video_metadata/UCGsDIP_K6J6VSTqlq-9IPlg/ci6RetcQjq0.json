The Internet exacerbates the challenge because it creates a nearly perfectly flat salience landscape. I enjoyed this conversation and I hope you will too. Notes below\n\nDDT so safe... https://youtu.be/gtcXXbuR244\n\nhow the internet flattens salience thru contradiction, how pattern finding in our frame of reference always directly implies a metalayer (how this relates to psychedelic experience), how context is created thru consumption (cults as curated information - salience manipulation), \n\nHeuristics function on what we call magical thinking\nEmploying magical thinking constantly throughout the day\nWashing our hands\nThat process, all we have done is call the bad stuff \u201cgerms\u201d and put the good stuff on\nHow deeply it impacts you psyche without noticing it\nAnti-vaxxers\nThe rise of the internet\nCollege violence\nWe don\u2019t have fins for this realm\nThere\u2019s no other way to curate the internet\nThe fundamental drives functioning on the internet are not as direct\nWe don\u2019t have a strong mechanism for sorting the internet\nWe have to decide what to focus on\nAndy Ng antifa Portland\nThe Internet itself is nearly a perfectly flat salience field\nThe human response is a cultural framing\nWe\u2019re getting a feedback loop\nThe effect of clickbait\nWhy do we eat at McDonalds\nLiterally changing our tastes\n\nPostmodernism is setting up the ground for flattened salience\nYou can\u2019t bite your own teeth, your eye can\u2019t see itself\nBuddhism\nAllowing of who I am rather than getting rid of who I am\nLooking at the postmodern condition is a form of baptism\nPostmodern context is a submergence into the water\nFear of drowning\nPeterson\u2019s chaos. The original symbol of chaos is the deep water\nDrowning in information\nBaptism of repentance\nKendrick lamar god as gangster\nSymbol of Christ\n\nLooking into the uncanny valley\nWe are stuck in the uncanny valley\nThe pit of the uncanny valley is the wax museum\nRelated to social media. We\u2019ve locked ourselves into the uncanny valley particularly in the image focused \nTwo ways to get out, towards the cartoonish, or more towards the hyper realistic\nVery positive reactions to the hyper cartoonish\nDeep negative reaction to those putting on a show that think they are real\nA dehumanizing effect\n \nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo
