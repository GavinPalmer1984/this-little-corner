 "description": "Interesting 4th visit @Lex Fridman  for Eric Weinstein. Lots of fairly usual Eric stuff here but I found his FU money and reputational cancelling to be an interesting portion of the video. This is along the lines of an incident with NY Times report using a racial slur. How does morality work? All of this in a week when I look at Jesus responding to reports of a Roman atrocity perpetrated by Pilate in their culture war.\n\nEric Weinstein #4 on Lex Fridman https://youtu.be/ifX_JnBfxTY\nthe Dispatch Words as Weapons https://thedispatch.com/p/words-as-weapons-how-activist-journalists\nRoss Douthat on the Portal https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/30-ross-douthat-the-rave-before-the-fall/id1469999563?i=1000471686956\nKenneth Bailey Poet and Peasant https://amzn.to/3r52Ip6\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
