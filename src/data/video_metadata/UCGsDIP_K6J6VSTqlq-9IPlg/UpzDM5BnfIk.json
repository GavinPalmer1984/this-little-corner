 "description": "Bret Weinstein offered his idea of \"metaphorical truth\" as being something of a useful fiction. He contrasted it with the \"literal\". I think this framework files not on the metaphorical side but on the imagined \"literalism\". Why? Because the world is stranger than we think. Persons are not what we imagine and they might be persons all the way up. How exactly? Look at the COVID conspiracies. Something conspires to keep this world as it us but they aren't human. How can we talk about them?
