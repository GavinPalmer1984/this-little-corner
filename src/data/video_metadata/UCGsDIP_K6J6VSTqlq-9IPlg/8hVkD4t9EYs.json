At university he joined a small charismatic campus church, got married, became a chemist, played music for the church. Agreed with Paul Anleitner about music being a sacrament in the charismatic church. In 2015 it felt like the world turned upside down. Discovered Jordan Peterson through Rod Dreher (like I did). Then Jonathan Pageau and then this channel. He like setting Psalms to music. He's still figuring out how to make Christianity work in this upside down world. \n\nMy conversation with Paul Anleitner https://youtu.be/7YrbAe8F2QI\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
