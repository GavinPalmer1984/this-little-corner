Debate? Nah. Budding friendship? \n\nA debate about capitalism, marxism and happiness begins and what they really want to talk about is Christian theology. Both JBP and Zizek hate identity politics and are marginalized by academics. What happened to the big debate over Marxism? Well apparently Zizek's Marxism is overrated and he's a Hegelian. Is Zizek a Marxist like JBP is a Christian? \n\nThe official video isn't out but there are plenty of pirated versions out on Youtube. I didn't do any clips. It's all just commentary. \n\nhttps://www.jordanvsslavojdebate.com/ (if it works...)\n\nPaul Maxwell Philosophy https://youtu.be/G5i2y5w8Dzc\n\nPhilip Cary Religion and Philosophy in the West
