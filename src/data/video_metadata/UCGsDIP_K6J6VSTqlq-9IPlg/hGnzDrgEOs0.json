This alone should qualify him for the title \"Son of (the creator) God\", yet Jesus' methods of colonizing history are regularly spurned as impractical the data not withstanding. Jesus seems again and again to take the long view, the VERY long view. One that not only includes his death but transcends it with resurrection. We see this early on in his career by heading to the Galilee and NOT taking up the sword because the sword eats as well as it gives. \n\nDominion by Tom Holland https://amzn.to/2NV86K4\nEric Weinstein Portal #19 Bret Weinstein https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kast-media-2/the-portal-2\n\nTo see the final cut you can see it here on the LSCRC channel. https://youtu.be/O5DRHL05JDQ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
