Last moments of his life he discovers everything\n\nI don't think our bodies are necessarily our own. \n\nFascinated by figures who are haunted by faith in Christianity. This sad deconstruction story, having grown up in the church, but he keeps wandering back, going to Nigeria, people who are living out their faith. \n\nDouglas is attracted to that. He's longing for that but he's trapped in this arid, post-Christian UK in the West. \n\nDouglas Murray and Tom Holland convo would go? \n\nJustin Brierley always pops the question\n\nTom needs a good marriage counselor between two parts of himself\n\nTom Holland on RE-enchantment\n\nSt. Margrets , \n\nDavid Nasser \n\nRod Dreher\n\nDeconstruction and intentionality\n\nPerformity with queerness\n\nFiddler on the roof: if God lived on earth people would break his windows\n\nStory is a sense-making mechanism, suffering, evil, \n\nThey fall short until they're connected to story\n\nYou can set good arguments but you also have to set a better story against it. \n\nAll true stories must reconcile\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
