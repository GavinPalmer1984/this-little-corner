 "description": "The question of \"lived experience\" vs data has the culture paralyzed. We blithely appeal to one or the other as if \"reality\" is some picture we select instead of understanding the nuances between one conscious center and various principalities we negotiate imaginatively. \n\nThe IDW leaders tend to speak in abstract terms about changing culture without having much experience with institutions that mold individual people and the mediating institutions which significantly shape people and hence the culture. \n\nEric Weinstein Rebel Wisdom David Fuller IDW https://youtu.be/GGtWwln491U\nEric Weinstein Bret Weinstein Dark Horse Podcast https://youtu.be/XjOg-OP_69Y\nPeter Thiel and Religion as the JPEG of Being https://youtu.be/HwM1bn1Ggi8\nBret Weinstein on Rebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/WigprYZPaLc\nGlenn Loury on Reason https://youtu.be/gp4fg9PWuhM\nGlenn Loury's story https://youtu.be/iZ1XWO3uTT8\nDominion Tom Holland https://amzn.to/2YJhjea\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
