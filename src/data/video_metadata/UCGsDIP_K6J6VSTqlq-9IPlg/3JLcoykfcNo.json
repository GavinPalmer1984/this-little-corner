 "date": "2020-01-17",
 "description": "The Unbelievable debate between Glen Scrivener and Matt Dillahunty really climaxed around secular humanism's durability. Dillahunty agreed that secular humanism is a product of Christian history (see Tom Holland's Dominion) but does it fray when it loses touch with it's religious roots? \n\nThe Nazis (according to Tom Holland) stand in for evil and the demonic for receding Christianity. Why? Where the Nazis Christian? What did they really believe? What is the relationship between environmentalism and the Nazis? Where the Nazis simply racist? What is the relationship between early evolutionary science and the Nazis? \n\nUnbelievable with Glen Scrivener and Matt Dillahunty https://youtu.be/B3-sjyDYO2I\nDelingpod with Tom Holland https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nA Cool Kid Communist Comeback https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/276374/a-cool-kid-communist-comeback\nDebunking anti-communism https://medium.com/@discomfiting/debunking-communism-killed-more-people-than-naziism-7a9880696f67\nMain Principles of Nazi ideology https://youtu.be/dwiYofBwKbc\nRichard Weikart From Darwin to Hitler https://youtu.be/w_5EwYpLD6A\nTimothy Snyder Black Earth https://amzn.to/2NxIS47\nHitler's Religion by Richard Weikart https://amzn.to/2RqIPZb\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
