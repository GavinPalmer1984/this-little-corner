John sees the need for wisdom institution as religious dependent on a \"two worlds mythology\" recede and that withdrawal deeply impacts human well-being. In fact the future of humanity as we know it is at risk because of this recession. \n\nTom Holland believes that despite the recession of the church, the wisdom institution of Christianity that has dominated Western history for the last 1500 years the influence of Jesus continues to permeate our lives through morality via a concept of reformatio. Editor of the only journal \"First Things\" critiques Holland's book Dominion because it fails to appreciate the relationship between full fledged belief and the moral gravity of reformatio. \n\nFinally I think we see in the popular sitcom \"The Good Place\" the abiding influence of \"two worlds mythology\" with the nuances of simulation and the contemporary questions of being, narrative and identity. Are \"two worlds mythologies\" really going away or just morphing? \n\nChristopher Mastropietro and I https://youtu.be/0h_6xrLP4Ac\nJohn Vervaeke on Rebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/yz6qgfjGMAg\nJohn
