He's been reading a lot of Barfield and pondering his work in connection with that of Jordan Peterson. How does truth telling impact charisma? \n\nOur First Talk https://youtu.be/82SzWEmQHCI\n\nNotes\nWhen I lie I fell like I\u2019m being pulled apart\nWhen you lie you slice the world up into smaller pieces, even yourself\nLife was compartmentalized in different areas\nDefault was nihilism\nWe think we can slice the world up and cut it into little pieces\nIdolization of the intellect\nThe imagination that what it is producing is knowledge\nAll the function and form of it has been lost in its current state\nSome of this use of language is an attempt to pause everything\nWhen we look back into history we imagine them as failed scientists\nWe imagine ourselves as scientists because technology is so powerful\nFalse dichotomy\nVervaeke\nShiobhan\nJohn Wood Jr. \nIf we don\u2019t amend the filter we won\u2019t see\nJordan Peterson\nThe lie, you can\u2019t not believe the things you say, you become attached to that. \nYou can\u2019t twist your use of language without twisting that thing inside of you that determines truth from error\nYou can\u2019t know if you\u2019re saying the truth but you can note when you\u2019re lying. \nIt\u2019s part of what makes him very charismatic\nCorrespondence between truth and charisma\nThe Great War\nMetaphysics of Quality talk\nSam Harris\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo
