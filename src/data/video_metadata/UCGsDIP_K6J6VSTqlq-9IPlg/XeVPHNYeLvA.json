Some sessions are recorded, others are not. I'm still working out how this fits into my channel overall. This was the session at 10am PDT June 5 2020. The Questions and timestamps are below. \n\n0:00  How did clinical psychology reshape the role of pastor\n11:00 God #1 and God #2\n23:30 What is at the heart of a lot of atheism\n33:30 What do I think of Critical Theory\n49:30 Is Nazism Critical Race Theory? \n56:00 Why is doubling down on Modernism a bad move for apologetics\n1:07:30 Leaving pure materialism. Looking at \"religion that's not a religion\" vs. historical religion route. Any help? \n1:19:15 How should Christians respond to the rising religious sentiment surrounding white guilt? \n1:27:00 Conservative church people adopting critical race theory jargon. \n1:44:45 Blind spots to the color blind narrative. They are becoming awoken to the systemic issues. Aspect that maps onto the public prayer problem. Performative public piety. How do we become away of the systemic problem without falling into the mimetic ritual bowing? All of the moral pressures are to dig into that amygdala response. How can we not look reactionary but still maintain a more careful and nuanced approached. \n1:56:00 The Ecumenism of \"this little corner of the Internet\". Many of the Christians have small o orthodox Christian credentials. Is our tribe a minority group or the future of the church? The essence of this group? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
