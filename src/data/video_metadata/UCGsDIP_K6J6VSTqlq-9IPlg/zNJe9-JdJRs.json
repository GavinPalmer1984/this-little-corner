Look at the fruit of what it bears\nReturn to the Christian roots\nTook the problem of evil seriously but it didn\u2019t lead to atheism\nThe argument created a data point on the goodness of God and existence of evil, and you can\u2019t get rid of transcendent morality\nProcess philosophy. Alfred North Whitehead, heartshorn, Omnipotence and other theological mistakes. \nMajor problems in Augustine and Aquinas pushed him towards philosophical Christianity\nIt really didn\u2019t have any practice\nBelieved in Jesus but no affiliation with a visible church\nMoved from being a none to a done\nOr maybe a never was\nThe search went from degree to degree to degree, philosophy, church history, PhD studies, \nTook a class in a patristic scholar, from Nicea to Constantinople. Reading all primary scources, all Eastern Fathers. Was disoriented by the Eastern Fathers. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m reading here. \nThe more he understood them the more compelling they were. \nTheir thought represented an alternative hypothesis but offered more. \nHallucinogens and Art\nMaryland Institute, Art School, intense full immersion\nPhilosophy school wasn\u2019t like he imagined\nFound a couple of professors that noticed his interest\nTransferred to Trinity Deerfield\nSpent a semester working for his dad\u2019s construction company\nAt the college he had more freedom than he would have with divinity school\nTerrible student growing up unpolished academically\nChris Firestone, equally unpolished. \nJohn Stackhouse\nCoauthored a book on Kant with Chris Firestone\nTrinity Evangelical Divinity School TEDS\nCalvin Seminary\nAt the doctoral level it was far more open\nPlantinga and Wolterstorff\nRichard Muller\nMet wife\nChalk line\nKilling Poe\nShe was very much an evangelical\nCommunion with the Orthodox church, in obedience to the priest\nTook 7 years. \nDavid Bradshaw, chair of philosophy department of Kentucky\nAncient Metaphysics\nGotta find an exit route out of the evangelical world\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nInterested in the Nones\nContinue in Film\nTree of Life\nLife Itself\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States", "duration": 5664, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hi this is Paul and I have a very", "start": 0.45, "duration": 5.429}, {"text": "special guest today dr.
