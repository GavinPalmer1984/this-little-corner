Gregg is a clinician and a full professor at James Madison University. \n\nEmail:                                                    henriqgx@jmu.edu;        \n\nHome page:                                        https://www.gregghenriques.com/\n\nUnified Theory of Knowledge:    https://www.unifiedtheoryofknowledge.org/\n\nFather had a Billy Graham conversion experience\nFather was a history prof\n\nRaised with a dawkins vent empriricism\n\nHour outside of DC\n\nReally like talking to people about what mattered\n\nIn the academy his whole life, a blue church\n\nBlue church believer as an undergrad\n\nWoke up into feminism, \n\nNorth Carolina Charlotte, Clinical community psychology\n\nCoherantist in terms of his disposition. Music rather than noise\n\nTheoretical structure is the mediating function\n\nTheory is the conduit between empiricle findins and practice\n\nWhat is the theoretical structure of psychology at the \n\nEvolutionary psychology\n\nTree of knowledge, Tree of knowledge, we can develop a big picture theory of psychology\n\nGarden philosophy\n\nFundamentally new set of conversations about science, wisdom, spirituality\n\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series\n\nJust before the Cathy Newman interview\n\nJEDI: Justice Equity Diversity Inclusion\n\nHe's a deep clinician. He's also a theorist. He's an empirical researcher, understands the scientific method and anchored\n\nSpiritual agnostic, his fundamental fascination why have these stories carried the impact they have carried? \n\nConscious evolution awakening\n\nNot up to the task of the problems and the nature of the world we're living in\n\nJustification systems\n\nThe problem of psychology, the materialist flatland\n\nSystems of Justification: network of propositions, is and ought, they give our lives certain meaning, we make sense of the world out of them. \n\nRooted in our justification and cosmopolitan among the other justifications\n\nBe pluralistic some, be open to the idea that there is some ultimate truth, \n\nCan we figure out a way to relate to each other with different justification systems, create a wisdom commons\n\nWe might not share the same ontology of the world\n\nYou go through different modes, as one person\n\nAliens\n\nIntegrated pluralism\n\nMeta-values: are there things that we, universal moral values\n\nThree meta-moral universal values: not the content of belief, what are sacred\n\nBe that which enhances, dignity, wellbeing with integrity\n\nCosmopolitan globalist: United declaration of human rights 1948, \n\nWhat justifies law? The justification for law was that people had dignity. \n\nFundamental dignity: confer to human beings fundamental dignity: abortion, euthanasia\n\nKarl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, belong and esteem\n\nIncremental dignity: did you live your best life today\u2026\n\nValuing the human condition. Incrementally in relationship.\n\nWell-being: Nested model of well-being. The elements that go into well-being and how to align them. The values of the evaluator. \n\nKant: happiness with the worthiness to be happy\n\nAristotle: eudaimonia: reaching your virtuous potential. Making a positive difference in the world\n\nIntegrity: honor, soundness, coherence, honesty\n\nGlobal way of being, a rooted way of being\n\nTracks the evolution of cultural consciousness, across 4 different sensibilities: Invite us to see if we can build a way of being that integrates these 4 sensibilities and honors them\n\n 1. The oral/indigenous sensibility: they reflect a lot of what our nature is, \n 2. Traditional sensibility: a nation and a religion, traditional formal world views that bring civilizations together with an identity. How do we live. Judeo Christian version of reality. \n 3. Modernity: lots of value. Lots of ways of thinking.  What emerges from science, Modernity pushes the church back and spreads, everywhere. Nietzsche  this is going to be bad news when it comes to making values\n 4. Post-modern critique of modernism, any scientific dogmatism that gets knocked off and critiqued. \n\nPeople have no idea of what their system of justification is. \n\nIs there a stance we can relate to our systems of justification. Feel them and know we need them and step outside of them. \n\nIf we get the right frame on it we can abstract the wisdom from these traditions. Feel relationally connected. \n\nThe traditional mode of operating. Wisdom traditions from the Axial age. \n\nPost-modern critique that warrants. You can take those four sensibilities. Might there be a way of making sense. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel
