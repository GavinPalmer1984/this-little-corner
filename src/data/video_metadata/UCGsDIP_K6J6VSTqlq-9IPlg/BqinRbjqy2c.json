Part of what their work has in common is called the frame problem. Human beings can't see and interact with the world without a frame but the framing of the world through something in the world is roughly equivalent to what Christianity calls idolatry. Christianity I believe asserts that God is the only frame that finally works in a world that is combinatorially explosive. I think this insight helps to explain a number of assertions in the Bible and Christian theology including the fact that God is everywhere, and in another sense nowhere, that God is not an object in the world, and that you can't see God and live. \n\nConversation with Christopher Mastropietro https://youtu.be/0h_6xrLP4Ac\nConversation with Guy Sengstock https://youtu.be/7dshAsIDP7I\nJBP and Vervaeke Feb 2015 https://youtu.be/-RCtSsxhb2Q (the Frame problem and meaning) \n\nNotes\nIs Relevance Realization God? \nHow to explain the emergence of mind?\nHomunculus fallacy\nHow does intelligent emerge out of processes? \nNo essences to fittedness\nReplace a Newtonian way of thinking with a Darwinian way of thinking\nSacredness and the Sacred\nThere is no essence to relevance\nThe inexhaustible moreness of reality\nJonathan Pageau\nJohn Hicks\nWilliam James\nIdolatry\nMachinery\nGod is the ancient answer to the framing problem\nThe worst things come from the best things turned bad\nPluralism\nBret Weinstein\nCreating god in the internet Age \nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
