I like Bret but he's on a mission that is incoherent. Humanity is coded for destruction and all we need to do to avoid the apocalypse is Mary Sue ourselves out of our genocidal programming. It's like a Terminator Robot deciding to become a pacifist just because it learned that killing is wrong. For a very smart guy on a very determined mission this is simply blind, especially after making a career that explains human behavior because of evolutionary code. \n\n0:00-2:34 Teaser Reading of the Tweets\n2:34-56:43 New Material\n\nBret and Jordan https://youtu.be/O55mvoZbz4Y\n\nJohn Vervaeke and Sam https://youtu.be/t3ZpIN85gBQ\n\nBret and Jamie Wheal on Rebel Wisdom https://youtu.be/KigJ5rn-4yE\n\nDaniel Bonevac normativity https://youtu.be/spBaumdWlgQ\n\nBret Jordan and Jonathan q and a https://youtu.be/0cLLFSdKZLI\n\nSevilla King Commentary https://youtu.be/gjyLYrG5lOc\n\nDue to a bot-attack we're reworking how to let new people into the Discord\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
