 "description": "The rise of secularity and the penetration of the meaning crisis have been directly related to the recession of a personal God. John Vervaeke has been working on the meaning crisis in his series \"Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\" and he has been a willing collaborator in engaging these questions. \n\nOver my last 2 years of pondering the work of Jordan Peterson I've been working through many issues in psychology and the Biblical Story. I've learned from Pascal, CS Lewis and Jonathan Pageau as well. What has developed is a \"little corner of the Internet\" where a few of us are having meaning conversations about God, meaning, existence and community. \n\nPDF of Powerpoint I use for this argument http://bit.ly/2Z5z1KN\nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis https://youtu.be/54l8_ewcOlY\nThink Big Animations (mentioned here) https://www.youtube.com/user/zekedeg\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
