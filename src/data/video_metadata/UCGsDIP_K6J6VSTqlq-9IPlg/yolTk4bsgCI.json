Why might we want there to be an afterlife that is not just pleasant but also consequential? Americans often believe that \"spirituality\" is self-evident but the diversity of ideas alone reveals this to be a naive idea. Most Americans imagine that morality not only involves a sense of universal or objective morality but also relational morality. There is also the complexity of personality traits in morality. We take an initial look at just how complex morality really is beyond the naive assumptions we often begin with. \n\nMichael Schur on the Ezra Klein Show https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/12/10/21002589/the-good-place-mike-shur-moral-philosophy-the-ezra-klein-show\nMy Name is Earl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Name_Is_Earl\nThe Good Place Afterlife Point System https://youtu.be/hY-Rzou38k4\nThe Good Place Doug Forcett https://youtu.be/HPEwD7WpI9g\nJordan Peterson Trait Agreeableness https://youtu.be/G1eHJ9DdoEA\nSoul Search, The Spiritual Assumptions of American Youth https://amzn.to/39h7uXm\nHitler's Religion https://amzn.to/2S5rKFO\nThe Good Place Judge https://youtu.be/4gw9Clr9kfc\nEleanor Shellstrop's mother https://youtu.be/Z0lsNJ1t_3A\nTimothy Keller Preaching https://amzn.to/2SaAY3H\nTom Holland Persian Fire https://amzn.to/31xG1Os\nCS Lewis Mere Christianity https://amzn.to/38eep3K\nCS Lewis the Abolition of Man https://amzn.to/3bjiXrl\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
