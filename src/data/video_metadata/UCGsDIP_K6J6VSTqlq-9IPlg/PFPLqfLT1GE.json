 "description": "Why was there no fight in the Peterson/Zizek debate? Because they both despise progressivism. But progressivism isn't progressivism an outgrowth of liberalism? Progressivism has a clear eschatology but does liberalism have an eschatology? We look at two post-debate commentary videos and follow John Vervaeke's analysis of the having/being distinction and his agent/arena ideas in application of liberalism's eschatology of human happiness. \n#paulvanderklay #zizekvspeterson #jordanbpeterson\n\nDamien Walter https://youtu.be/-t50RKt3kr0\nJBP's \"Classic Liberal\" video https://youtu.be/HxfFxhERMYY\nMr. Reagan's AOC Video https://youtu.be/1h5iv6sECGU\nTeaching to Transgress https://youtu.be/A0W9QbkX8Cs\nWhy does the left always win? https://youtu.be/6erb4WY8xxs\nThe Political Compass https://youtu.be/5u3UCz0TM5Q\nRoxanne Gay vs Christina Hoff Sommers https://youtu.be/-BYREt2r_uQ\nNY Mag piece on the debate http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/inside-the-near-meltdown-of-the-feminist-tour-in-australia.html\nXelasoma on Zizek/JBP https://youtu.be/tlwJwtuePD4\nSlate Star Codex How the West was won https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/\nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis 15 https://youtu.be/FvLe4BuU-NM\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://lbry.io/ @paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
