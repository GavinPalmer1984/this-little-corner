While Progressives major in stories of suffering and pain Conservatives like to talk about \"Reformed Hermeneutics\". They assert that the issue isn't isolated to this particular issue but it with the pattern of Scripture reading. I think they have a point. How we read the Bible continues to evolve and it is a standard point with Progressive Evangelicals. Peter Enns, former professor of Old Testament was featured on the Youtube Channel @God is Grey  to discuss his book \"How the Bible Actually Works\". \n\nWhile Pete Enns and I may agree on a number of things I suspect the sum total of these assumptions about the Bible sort of blur it for people. For those who have been deeply formed by a more orderly sub-culture, who might wish to deviate in a few ways, this feels like a relief from tyranny. But what will be the cumulative impact of these changes as generations continue? \n\nI find the work of @Jonathan Pageau to actually be anticipating the impact of this blur further in. He notes patterns and subtly suggest how to navigate with these patterns. It's both a re-enchantment move AND a re-instantiation of the Biblical world in the lives of those who listen.\n\nCRC End of Life Directive? https://youtu.be/009hziHYmQg\nPete Enns How the Bible Actually Works https://amzn.to/3un7Pmw\n@God is Grey How the Bible Actually Works https://youtu.be/sbELxpLOKg4\nStrange Rites https://amzn.to/3uoDkMY\n@Jordan B Peterson Paul Rossi https://youtu.be/ysQBegyQP8A\n@Jonathan Pageau Universal history https://youtu.be/_N5s4n_lwB8\n@Benjamin A Boyce and Jonathan Pageau https://youtu.be/mWcKXrBm7R4\nSubstack https://paulvanderklay.substack.com/p/jonathan-pageaus-subtle-form-of-evangelism\n\nSymbolic memez https://youtu.be/WblmogrIC0w and https://youtu.be/h5o09kj9wSA\n\nDiscord link.
