 "description": "We've been watching the transformation of Job from depressed atheist through Jordan Peterson phenom to church membership as an atheist to leadership in the Discord server to possibilities of leadership in his local church. Job's been very transparent about this whole process. \n\nI thought it would be fun to sit down with Rod Hugen from The Village in Tuscon, John Van Donk from Crosspoint in Southern CA, and myself just for a fun chat. Job wanted to use the time to reflect on how the strange events of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon have changed our lives over the last two years with my videos and the meetups we've started. I thought it was a great topic so why not. This is where the conversation went. \n\nRod Hugen can be found at The Village on Tucson http://www.villagersonline.com/\nJohn Van Donk hosts meetups https://www.meetup.com/Jordan-Peterson-Inland-Empire-Meetup/\nJob is easily found in the comments or on the Discord server (see link below)\n\nNotes\nOuter court ministry\n\nWhat I'm personally very interested in, gentlemen -- is how each of you has been experiencing this movement over the last two years. What have you found? Where do you think it is going? What role should you play? What role might the church play?\n\nSurge of atheist seekers\n\nMore socially acceptable of being atheists\n\nDepression and the grand search for meaning\n\nSearching for big T Truth\n\n4 ways of knowing, procedural, propositional, perspectival, participatory\n\nCrc\n\nThe Ordination of (still sort-of-atheist) Job\n\nThe resurrection and the Salton Sea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
