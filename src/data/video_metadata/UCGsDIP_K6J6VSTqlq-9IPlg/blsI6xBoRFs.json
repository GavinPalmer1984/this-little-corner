Political rivals are now evil. Families can't eat together. Why? \n\nOver the last 50 years we've seen the de-institutionalization of Christianity which has paved the way for many to have their politics become their religion. Politics as religion is bad, dangerous eventually bloody religion. Dread Christian nationalism on one side and Successor Religion/Imperialism on the other. It can't end well. \n\nYou will only escape it if you actually have a religion. Religions slow you down, make you submit, put a traditional and institutional governor on our biases and appetites. \n\n12 Rules for Life https://amzn.to/2NKalD5\nMaps of Meaning 1 2017 https://youtu.be/I8Xc2_FtpHI\ndogs barking https://twitter.com/LloydLegalist/status/1352023803296149506\nNicholas Kristof https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/opinion/sunday/progressive-christians-politics.html\nChristian Nationalism https://youtu.be/Sz2YylX4k8A\nJesus and John Wayne https://amzn.to/3tOX3Vn\nFundamentalism and American Culture https://amzn.to/3cffU5Q\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2021/01/how-the-civil-rights-movement-converted-liberal-white-protestants-to-secularism/\nScrewtape Letters https://amzn.to/31bVm85\n\nDiscord link.
