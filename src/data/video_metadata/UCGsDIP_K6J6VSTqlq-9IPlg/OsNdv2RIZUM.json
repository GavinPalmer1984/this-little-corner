 "description": "Is JBP Cyrus? John the Baptist? I think he's the unauthorized exorcist from Mark 9. The problem is that materialism has messed up our understanding of Nature and Miracles.

He's exorcising \"demons\". \n\nThe Grand Miracle Doodle https://youtu.be/Uv4kx2QP4UM\nJBP \"Am I a Christian?\" https://youtu.be/RIB05YeMiW8 \nCS Lewis Miracles https://www.amazon.com/Miracles-C-S-Lewis-ebook/dp/B002BY77FY\nMiracles with Simon Vance https://www.audible.com/pd/Miracles-Audiobook/B002V8KS3S  \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
