 "description": "In my second talk with Nathan we start to get into the shape of unbelief of post-Christian Nones. The movies \"Life Itself\" and \"Stranger than Fiction\" illustrate two aspects the conflict between the impersonality of their weakened Karma, their desire for justice and meaning. I want to know what a \"person\" is which leads to a very long explanation of the difference between Augustine, Boethius, and the Eastern Fathers on the Trinity and why it matters. Lots of analysis of contemporary post-Christian unbelief, philosophy and theology. We'll talk again because we're only starting to explore.\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States\n\n\nHis movie: Becoming Truly Human  Becoming Truly Human. https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Truly-Human-Nathan-Jacobs/dp/B0759QXCCG\nOur First Conversation https://youtu.be/zNJe9-JdJRs\nLife Itself https://www.amazon.com/Life-Itself-Oscar-Isaac/dp/B07FJNY7MT\nStranger than Fiction https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-than-Fiction-Will-Ferrell/dp/B000NTHT6G\n\nConversation Notes\nBecoming truly human\nStranger than Fiction\nDr. Jim\nStoic philosophy\nThe passions\nApathea\nYou have cultivated a gap between impulse and reaction\nIf it\u2019s appropriate to be angry here\u2026\nImpassability of God by ancients and greek philosophy\nProcess philosophy and theology\nOpen theism\nPersonhood\nHyposis\nPersona\nAugustine \nAugustine arrives as persons as relations\nRealism vs nominalism\nIs that a fabrication of the mind\nWay of mentally grouping things but the groups aren\u2019t real\nRealism says these categories are real outside of the mind, \nWe are participating\nExtreme realism vs moderate realism\nRafael school of Athens\nWhere are the forms\nIdeal substance\nThe good of a thing is the closer it gets to its archetype\nAristotle says this is problematic because\u2026 the third man problem\nAristotle\u2019s conclusion is that abstract definitions, the ideal is the basic definition\nNo concrete existence until it manifests in matter\nMatter and form, Clay already has form inside ofit\nWhat matter truly is, is just the potential to be something\nMatter is pure potential\nCombination of matter and form\nDun Scotus\nThe thisness of the thing, hexeatas\nThe one non-repeatable property: being this and not that\nBoethius on the Trinity\nHypastus\nAthanasius of Alexandria vs Arius\nHomoousia vs homoiousia\nMost people us \u201cGod\u201d as an individual \nTheos as the divine nature, as a predicate\nThe english is misleading\nThe ancients don\u2019t indigenize words and ideas\nThey see language as sign posts\nConstantinople \nHypostis ousia\nThey are synonyms prior to Constantinople \nA rift between realists and nominalists\nCyril of Alexandria\nAny individual has three components\nThe difference between individuals come down to the natures \nMaterial, potential to be something, underrights the possibility of change\nAll these things are underwritten by matter\nThe matter underwrites the possibility of change\nProperties: subsets: essential properties, accidental properties\nIndividual\nMaterial\nProperties\n\nAristotles 4 causes\n\nThree things from the Patristics\nHow critical realism is to the answering of these questions\nNatural law ethics\nLife Itself vs the Eastern Patristic God\nMaximus the Confessor talks about Christ\u2019s descent into Hades\nLewis in the Space Trilogy\nUniversal salvation\nReality of hell",
