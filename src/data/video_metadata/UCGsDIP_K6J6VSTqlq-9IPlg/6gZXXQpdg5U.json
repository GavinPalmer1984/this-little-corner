 "description": "Growing up in the Christian Reformed Church meant my family had some strange \"Sabbath\" traditions. It was difficult for me to understand why we did this on Sunday. As a church we would even read the 10 commandments and it clearly says \"Sabbath\" \n\nThe evolution of Jewish Sabbath observance to Christian Sunday observance is a long one. I give a fast tracing of that through to today. I also believe that the Heidelberg Catechism gets the transformation correct in terms of how Christian Sunday celebration of the resurrection both connects us with the Genesis creation story through the development of Christian worship replacing Synagogue worship and in anticipation of the \"eternal Sabbath rest\". \n\nThe Lost World of Genesis 1 https://amzn.to/2GPjXss\nThe Heidelberg Catechism https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
