You cannot reduce the world to physics\nA system that evolves in response to changes in environment\nWhen you introduce self-reference into any system you have bizarre effects\n\nCord Godall \nAlan Turing\nUndecidability theorem\nIf you introduce self-reference the system becomes completely unpredictable\nPhysical reductionism and physical determinism are impossible\nPersons is a story, we are a history, \nBenjamin Libet experiments\nLaplace\u2019s demon, you have to tell me before the event\nSelf-reference\nValid formal proof that scientific determinism is incorrect\nKarl Gruner destroys Sam harris\nStrong distinction between physical and natural\n\u201cEmerges\u201d from physical processes\nGame theory\nNassim Talib (books in the order they were published) Fat tail distributions\n\nConfusing uncertainty with mere probability distribution. Kind of rules to apply to a complex world are very different from the rules we apply to a complicated system. \nBlack Swan event\nThe great danger is thinking you know something that you really don\u2019t\nPseudo scientific confidence in our capacity to predict\nThey think they know a lot more than they do. \nDaniel Kaneman Thinking Fast and Slow, research is excellent but the conclusion is false.
