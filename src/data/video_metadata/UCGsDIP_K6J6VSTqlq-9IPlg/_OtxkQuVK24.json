Here he challenges a big part of Jordan Peterson's project in Maps of Meaning. The article is here. https://alexanderdouglas.medium.com/jordan-petersons-maps-of-meaning-no-it-s-not-legit-763d9373db65\n\nWhile I'm not necessarily interesting in the intramural Jungian debate it relates to a lot of my recent ponderings on Cartesian dualism, Western default metaphysics and Christianity.
