It's time to do that digging. \n\nInterview with Po the Person https://youtu.be/XK1Y3IBKAtE\nJordan Peterson at Lafayette College https://youtu.be/V32WHDuy-Do\nJordan Peterson on Firing Line http://www.pbs.org/wnet/firing-line/video/jordan-peterson-hreb9p/\n\"Best debate ever Christian vs Atheist Christian wins\" https://youtu.be/SdEvXK91B58\nBrian Welch Surrenders to Jesus https://youtu.be/nev4RBKMiec\nPeople tell a real pastor they don't believe in God https://youtu.be/jeyVV9Ckpt4\n\"Epic Debate over God's Existence\" https://youtu.be/aUKIVV48LOk\nSpeak Life More Christian Than we Think https://youtu.be/KN8UNNMEwZs\nRichard Cayley Rene Girard https://amzn.to/3npx4Bn\nRhett's Spiritual Deconstruction https://youtu.be/1qbna6t1bzw\nLink's Spiritual Deconstruction https://youtu.be/w1AZhlyoD9s\nTaking Up God's Name in Translation https://youtu.be/LSANm4UnIxA\nTom Holland did Religion Exist in the Ancient World https://youtu.be/ZeCTC_r4vMI\nJordan Peterson Death and Resurrection in 5 Parts https://youtu.be/xPIanlF6IwM\nT.M.
