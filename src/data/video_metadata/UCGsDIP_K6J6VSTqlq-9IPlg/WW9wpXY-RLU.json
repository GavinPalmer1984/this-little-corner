 "description": "John is a musician who before COVID was managing and producing musicians but has now been sidelined. He's got a lot of wisdom about how musicians get stuck and so we compare notes on working with people. It think this is a conversation you'll enjoy. \n\nProfessional musician then became a production person\nNot book anything until 2021\n\nRaised RC, sent to church until 17 or 18\n22 years ago, self-awareness training, not political\nFound myself in a position for defending myself about not knowing what was going on\nInsulted into voting\nWatched the election returns. I don't know what's going on\nMade me interested cognitively \nStarted getting into Youtube videos, interesting and useful\nMost bands are dysfunctional families\nHad a Sam's club membership. Lots of stuff in the book section. CS Lewis compilation\nFound Jordan Peterson just before the election. Watched all of his videos. \nAll this wisdom out there is in a story. It's how we relate to them.\nEric and Bret Weinstein\nLove the biological insight from Heather and Bret\nEasy steps for musicians to follow to make their bands more successful\nScott Adams, I'm naked in the desert here\u2026\nTrump Derangement Syndrome\nTwo final things, filters, Let's try this path\nAnother view of Jesus smuggling\nTMZ\nTaking things in as information is different from confirmation, \nMusicians\nThey take snapshots of it and they judge\nThey have elephant like memories if they feel like they've been wronged\nIn a reframing way that brings it back to the worst common denominator\nEgo driven like children, they're a pawn to their ego\nTakes up that space\nGives value to these things. You choose what you give value to\nThat process at the funeral takes every person to the end of the story",
