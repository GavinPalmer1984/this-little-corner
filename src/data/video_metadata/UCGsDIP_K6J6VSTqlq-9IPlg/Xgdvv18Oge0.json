 "description": "The last 20 years has seen the rise of the Nones, people who don't affiliate with any religion. This hasn't been a bonanza for new atheists, in fact those who leave traditional religion embrace a sort of karma/justice/spiritualism whose rules seem to follow those of secular screen writers. \n\nNathan Jacobs dissects this with his own movie \"Becoming Truly Human\" and here he lectures a group of Orthodox clergy on what he learned from the Nones. \n\nReaching the Nones https://youtu.be/ME54BibXfYs\nClay Routledge Behind the Meaning Crisis https://youtu.be/3luYGnWa7H4\nJordan Peterson and Roger Scruton at Cambridge https://youtu.be/XvbtKAYdcZY\nCS Lewis the Problem of Pain https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Pain-C-S-Lewis-ebook/dp/B002BD2USY\nClay Routledge Supernatural https://www.amazon.com/Supernatural-Death-Meaning-Power-Invisible-ebook/dp/B07D3S1YNT\nBecoming Truly Human https://youtu.be/vEmBnju-518\nNathan Jacobs http://www.nathanajacobs.com/\nLife Itself trailer https://youtu.be/b5kwtJkUdpA\nStanley Hauerwas https://mereorthodoxy.com/stanley-hauerwas/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
