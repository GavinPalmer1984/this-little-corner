{"video_id": "P69vAtJRIhg", "channel_id": "UCGsDIP_K6J6VSTqlq-9IPlg", "channel_name": "Paul VanderKlay", "title": "Why I Take Viewer Conversations and New Guidelines for Signing Up", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P69vAtJRIhg", "date": "2019-08-07", "description": "Link to new guidelines https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nI love having conversations (or converZations as people tease me) with people you watch my YouTube channel. I\u2019ve had so many requests I need to establish some structure to it. Here is the structure.\n\n1. If you\u2019ve had two conversations with me then be gracious and let some first timers have a chance at the queue. Think about finding one to three others who you\u2019ve seen on the channel to do a group with. When you\u2019ve got a group and you can agree on a time slot sign up for one.\n\n2. I love meeting new people. As a pastor I\u2019m particularly interested in your story of faith or unbelief. Why do you believe in God? Why can\u2019t you believe in God? Why don\u2019t you want to believe in God? How does all that work in you? I\u2019ll likely lead you with questions and explore it with you. That\u2019s a lot of what a pastor does. I won\u2019t pressure you or bully you or try to scare you. I want to hear your story and help you put it out there so you can see it from a different perspective.\n\n3. Your Jordan Peterson journey or your journey through the Meaning Crisis. I\u2019m curious about how that is going for you. As a pastor I rely on first hand accounts. No one has probably written a book on you so lay it out for me. I\u2019ll help you by asking questions. Pastors help people curate and garden their stories.\n\n4. Is there a particular idea you want to talk about? My channel isn\u2019t really the place where you have a chance to promote a project or even a cause. You can start your own channel for that. If there is an idea explain to me why it\u2019s important to you and your life, not just in the abstract. Where does it impact your ideas? Again, if we\u2019ve already spoke a couple of times try to find some friends who have already spoken with me (on or off the air) and maybe we can find a slot to talk about something.\n\n5. Consider starting your own channel. Others have done it. Consider gathering others together for a time to meetup on line. If you let me know and I have the chance I might be able to join. Consider editing down your group conversation and if it\u2019s good enough maybe I\u2019ll post it. Maybe I\u2019ll start a sub-channel. I don\u2019t know yet.\n\nI\u2019ve had to do some thinking in terms of this new aspect of my life, my ministry and my career. I pastor a marginally viable congregation. In pastor-speak \u201cmarginally viable\u201d means they might have trouble always being able to cover my salary. I might start to look for more income in the future from this source. My congregation is small and very generous with my time but there are limits to the time and attention I can pay outside of this local church. I\u2019m waiting for JBP to put out his Thinkspot. Maybe I\u2019ll work on that. Maybe I\u2019ll develop something else. We\u2019ll see.\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333
