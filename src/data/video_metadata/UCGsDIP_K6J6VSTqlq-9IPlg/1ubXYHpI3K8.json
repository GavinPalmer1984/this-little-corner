 "title": "Jordan Peterson's interpretation of \"the meek\" in the Sermon on the Mount is Wrong-ish",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ubXYHpI3K8",

 "description": "THE most frequently asked question I get about Jordan Peterson concerns his interpretation of \"the meek\" in the Sermon on the Mount. He cites an alternate meaning of the Greek wood \"praus\" translated \"meek\". Why would Jesus say \"blessed are the meek\" when the meek are victims almost by definition? Is Jesus saying his followers are to be passive dishrag doormats? How can this be squared with the kind of robust masculinity we see in Abraham or David or Moses? Was Jesus a wimp? \n\nA number of Peterson followers have told me that recovering masculinity in Christianity has been important for their decision to return to it. If Peterson is wrong on \"the meek\" does that invalidate his perspective? \n\nIt has a lot to do with context and what a \"Beatitude\" is especially in a eschatalogical (last things) or apocalyptic setting. How can those who have no power be the ones that God rescues and to whom God finally gives victory over their adversaries? \n\nDo those who have no power or hope of success in the competitions or injustices of this world have hope for vindication and triumph? A lot of that depends on what you believe about the resurrection of the dead. \n\nBiblical Series IX https://youtu.be/GmuzUZTJ0GA?t=1h42m24s \n \nAugust 2017 Patreon https://youtu.be/MeNxc6MqXuM?t=0h9m10s\n\nI don't like pouring too much into \"meek\" because the Sermon on the Mount is intended to deliver an eschatalogical shock. If you blunt \"meek\" you will faith to deliver on what Jonathan Edwards calls the \"diverse excellencies\" https://paulvanderklay.me/2016/12/02/diverse-excellencies-from-tim-keller/ . Jesus is archetypal because he is maximally meek AND dangerous at the same time but if you cloud the word \"meek\" you lose that language to draw that contrast.",
