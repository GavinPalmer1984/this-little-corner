The new 12 points he announced in this video was different from those rules. We'll have to see how they developed. Such a development is pretty normal in the process of putting out a book especially given everything he's been through. \n\nI was very encouraged by this announcement. The content seems fresh and a further development of what he's done before. I eagerly await an opportunity to read this book and I am especially encouraged by his ability to finish it and present it in this way. \n\nhttps://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-for-Life-audiobook/dp/B0797Y87JC\n\nTo Pre-Order \"Beyond Order\": https://amzn.to/363ohyt\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
