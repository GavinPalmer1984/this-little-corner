 "description": "I was recently on @Rebel Wisdom talking about the conversation between David Fuller and Jonathan Rowson reflecting on @Jordan B Peterson 's first wave. Many asked what would the second wave bring? \n\nWhile I was editing the audio for today's Q/A I caught this bit of Peterson and Heather Heying on @Triggernometry  where I thought Jordan gave a very clear and concise version of his argument. This is encouraging to me that we might see more focus and follow through in the second wave. Here is the video. https://youtu.be/qKL8slQzX2w\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
