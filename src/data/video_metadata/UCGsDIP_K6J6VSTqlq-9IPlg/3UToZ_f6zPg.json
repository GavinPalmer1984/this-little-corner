Many conversations focus on the Bible which is very Protestant of us, but that often results on many trying to interpret the Bible in context by getting behind the Bible historically. One question I never hear asked is why did stigma about same sex behavior develop in the first place? \n\nGK Chesterton used an analogy that if you find a fence and it isn't immediately obvious why the fence maker put the fence where he or she did, you might want to find that answer before you remove the fence. It might be helpful to ask \"why did stigma about same sex sexuality develop in the first place?\" \n\nSoul Searching by Christian Smith https://amzn.to/3AKztgp\nCS Lewis The Problem of Pain https://amzn.to/3kIydot\nIan McGilchrist The Master and his Emissary https://amzn.to/3obaVcM\nJonathan Haidt the Righteous Mind https://amzn.to/3i6Ryy0\nChurch Needs a Confessional Conversation https://youtu.be/QMQytRMxW6c\nIdeals Instantiated https://youtu.be/erOsxSn9gCE\nReligion and Philosophy in the West https://amzn.to/3ueKMuC\nThe Clockwork Universe https://amzn.to/3kJ78BC\nCS Lewis Miracles https://amzn.to/3oeF1fB\nHunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century https://amzn.to/3uiji7I\nControlling Men's Bodies https://youtu.be/AdWfmNjWnsc\n@Jordan B Peterson Death and Resurrection https://youtu.be/xPIanlF6IwM\nCRC and Same  Sex Marriage Conversation https://youtu.be/SuRl-smHdSc\nNT Wright and Tom Holland on @Unbelievable? https://youtu.be/nlf_ULB26cU\nPastor went New Age Tweet Slippery Slope https://twitter.com/WokePreacherTV/status/1441035668700995586\nRyan Meeks Explains why he gives up the Christian ministry https://youtu.be/V9ocSv3fGgE\nChristine Hayes @YaleCourses https://youtu.be/wRPqtGywkCw\nPlato's Symposium https://amzn.to/3zDEgyQ\nThings beneath SSM conversation https://youtu.be/8mFbippKmn0\nMarriage Equality death of Protestant churches https://youtu.be/IXgdRQgZNJE\nCruciform Process https://youtu.be/-xZUaQyDamA\nProgressive Christianity https://youtu.be/vDDb3FS4KaM\n\nDiscord link.
