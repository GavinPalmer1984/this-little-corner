 "title": "Is the Christian Reformed Church Moving Forwards or Backwards on Race Relations in Chicago?",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cz_H7B0wcI",
 "date": "2020-06-19",
 "description": "For those who know the history of the CRC Chicago was a pivotal epicenter in its history of race relations. The Timothy Christian School lawsuit prompted the Synod to start the Synodical Committee on Race Relations. It was a defining moment in the CRC embracing second wave anti-racism. Those days are now well in our past and Critical Race Theory is increasingly the template that is shaping the language used around race relations. I sit down with someone who lived the old style of racial reconciliation in the denomination for his take on what's going on in Chicago. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
