This intensifies identity tribal warfare creating a game of tribal Othello where the goal is to always outframe and flip the adversary. Christians play this game too and it doesn't go well because Christian conversion is ultimately a humiliation. In Christ we receive an identity, it is not achieved. \n\nWalter Wangarin Jr. Ragman https://amzn.to/36kdtu0\nCharles Taylor Sources of the Self https://amzn.to/32ZyMyF\nCharles Taylor Ethics of Authenticity https://amzn.to/2NqnNIg\nCyrus Dunham https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/cyrus-grace-dunham-lets-everyone-name-themselves.html\nMy Conversation with Jordan Peterson https://youtu.be/aUGGrZUFMg4\nKanye West Big Boy TV https://youtu.be/t568Nd7k_Yk\nKanye West Apple TV https://youtu.be/QuOCvKvrwI8\nBrad Pitt Kanye West https://youtu.be/EdZgkM_XF0I\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2PsYyrn\nAndrew Klavan Great Good Thing https://amzn.to/2JAlq4r\nAndrew Klavan Acton Institute https://youtu.be/PX60VEEbmEI\nRagman Story on YouTube https://youtu.be/Q6paKdR9dIE\nKingdom in the Streets and The Call by Ken Medema, Copywright Ken Medema\nKen Medema Music http://kenmedema.com/\nDistributist Contrapoints Retrospective Political YouTube https://youtu.be/IBL2J-gFUOo \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
