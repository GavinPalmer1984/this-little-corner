 "description": "The Bridges of Meaning Discord Q/A Session from June 12 2020 \n\n0:00 Vervaeke Religion that isn't a religion, AA, secularity, Trump and his Bible  1. Religion that's not a religion on the Vervaeke channel. What's going on among theists and non-theists alike, the individual or cultural level. Sense of fatigue or exasperation among self-sovereignty. That's a big deal. It sets up the next move. \"Difficult creatures to manage. \" What we call the sacred is what we relinquish what we the ability to sacrifice. We allow something else to govern and share our agency. In AA it's not explicitly Christian but deeply Christ haunted. When you consider all the different things you permit to govern you, money, power, the unexpected surprise that the non-coercive has marked us. I don't know that we can settle for any lesser principality or zeitgeist. Possible to be under the auspices of caritas without being explicit. Dialogos, mutual and deep recognition. How do you constitute the sacred in the secular frame. \nSome evangelicals think that public religious gestures (e.g. Trump's holding the Bible) will halt secularization. They won't. They ENACT SECULARIZATION: they put the sacred to profane use that's contrary to the character of the sacred. That's desecration and hence secularization.\n\n28:20 Vervaeke, People on the Vervaeke discord server are trying to nudge up against the sacred. Where can Theists and non-Theism alike do that? Common Ground? \n\n35:00 The reality of angels and demons\n\n53:45 My tradition classifies sin in two categories: (1) personal sin (deliberate and willful) and (2) original depravity (sinful, but not consciously willful). There's a lot of talk about \"systemic sin\" particularly in relation to systemic racism. Does \"systemic sin\" nest neatly in one or both of the existing categories - or do parts of it spill into a third category? This may seem like a dry theological point... but my church is really struggling with some of the downstream consequences of this debate. NOTE: I won't be able to attend the live chat. Please skip my question if only live attendee questions are accepted. Obviously, will not be available to clarify or follow-up.Sin, Racism, systems\n\n1:03:10 Job Angels, Demons and the buffered self\n\n1:11:30 God of the Gaps and Natural Events, giving purpose to these events\n\n1:19:00 A while back you stated a preference for the term Universal truth as opposed to Objective. I think I see the disadvantage of the term \"Objective\" in that it brings to mind Sam Harris's world of Amazon boxes waiting to be manipulated, but what opportunities do you see in describing Truth as universal and how does it avoid the modernist pitfalls of the term \"Objective?\" Thanks again!\n\n1:23:45 Myths Mysticism, experiential searching for God, Protestant mysticism. Good functional mysticism. \n\n1:30:45 Is race/ethnicity a part of one\u2019s identity that should be valued (i.e., as a point of pride, brotherhood, community, etc.), or should it be regarded as no different from height or blood type? I\u2019m inclined to the latter, but this question is complicated by the existence of communities which are very much defined by their racial identity, for very understandable reasons.\n\n1:38:00 Can we replace \"privilege\" talk with \"blessing/blessed\" talk? What would be gained? What would be lost?\n\n1:48:00 Follow up on Shari's Vervaeke Theist/non-theist question. it does seem like people who do not want to find God keep tripping over him in their search for meaning, yet bend over backwards to explain these moments away...why are some so resistant?\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
