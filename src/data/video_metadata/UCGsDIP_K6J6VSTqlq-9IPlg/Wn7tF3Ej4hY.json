 "description": "It's been a while since Jonathan and I have had a conversation. We talked about the Jordan Peterson Wave, Jonathan's retreat from the IDW space, the absence felt of Jordan in that space. We hope that the September 2020 conference in Thunder Bay won't get cancelled. We talked about John Vervaeke's project a bit, the rise of stoicism, Orthodoxy and religion in the West. \n\nJonathan's Channel https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan\n\nDonkey Kong https://youtu.be/6nQvVpLnZCw\n\nLilith https://youtu.be/XMwrObsGGzE\n\nPandemic positive aspect\n\nForcing everybody to stop\n\nActing like Sabbath and Jubilee\n\nIDW\n\nBreakdown of the West, affords opportunity\n\nOpen spaces are happening, there\u2019s more connectivity\n\nPossibility for a flip\n\nHe took it out of the abstract, and choose a place, this thing here is where I\u2019m not going to move. \n\nIt was near arbitrary.
