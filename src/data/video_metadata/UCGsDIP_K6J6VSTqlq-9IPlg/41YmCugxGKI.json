 "description": "Byrne Power joins me for our second conversation. We go deeper into what happened with L'Abri and the Schaeffers, why so many intersections between L''Abri and Jordan Peterson. Lots of good stuff from Byrne in this one. \n\nYou can find his YouTube Channel Here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIAtCuzdvgNJvSYILnHtdWA \nand https://www.youtube.com/user/gulagzero\n\nHis website https://theanadromist.wordpress.com/\n\nHere are the notes. \nShaefer\nLabri library\nTaxi driver\n70s film\nJesus people turned cult\nSolzenitzen\nFrankie Schaefer\nWhen people come back they don\u2019t want to do evangelism anymore\nOct 1978\nSchaeffer just finished filming and had cancer\nRookmaaker\nBooks to read, tutor to talk to\nJonestown incident occurred\nHow much harm is done by people who claim to know what love is\nThank you Jordan Peterson\nFrench woman was an atheist and communist who had heard of Jonestown\nFrench woman asked \u201cwhat makes you different from them?\u201d \nThey were telling you things to question what you believed\nSchaeffer didn\u2019t just let you say what you believe without explaining it\nThey\u2019re teaching me to question even them\nThe tensions of L\u2019abri were starting in 1980\nThings started getting more propagandistic\nAny topic had been on the table\nRookmaaker was an unlikely convert. He went into the church and never got over what he saw in the church. Brilliant on the subject of art.\nThe honesty of wrestling about things. Honest to the point of genuine emotion. Take any question that comes to them. Emphasize learning and reading\nThe 80s was a rough period for L\u2019Abri\nEllul, where discussion begins, propaganda ends\nClick, then I\u2019m trying to get you saved\nEfficiency, the more we seek to be efficient, the less human we become\nMeaning\nRookmaaker\u2019s lecture on reality\nReality is meaning\nCS Lewis the Discarded Image\nFour part series of Rookmaker on Art\nComplete works of Rookmaker\nBarfield\nThe Rediscover of Meaning\nTo the degree that we are individuals we are alienated and isolated from each other\nSaving the Appearances\nBarfield on Coleridge \nRookmaker: the meaning of scholarship\nCharles William figure of Beatrice, the meaning of the city\nmichael polanyi personal knowledge\nmichael polanyi mp3 you can find his lectures, 4 of them\nKnowledge is personal, everyone\u2019s knowledge.\nWhere does the hypothesis come from? \nEllul: the Political Illusion\nWalker Percy: Lost in the Cosmos, The loss of the creature\nOur first environment is nature. We get everything good from there, but also all of the worst things. In order to fight that we created the second environment. Society. The social world. We\u2019re protected from some of the worst ravages from nature, but all of the problems of the social world. Love, heartache, conflict, strife, war, disease. Now technology. We live inside of technology. \nEllul died on the day Jackie Kennedy died\nTarkofsky, Sculpture and Time\nWe are at war with reality. We want a perfect world. The more we try to get there the more we put the gun to our head. \nThe last place will be the first place. \nWhen we get to the garden of eden, we\u2019ll finally find out what the sword was, the thing that won\u2019t allow us to get back to the garden. \nUtopia\nASMR\nTexture\nWhen we\u2019re missing a texture we create plastic or digital imitations of it\nPuppetry as an antidote art\nPropaganda and social media\nConceptual humanity\nTexture and meaning\nHow could people find what they do in science if they weren\u2019t already there\nChristians are practically atheists\n \nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
