 "description": "Andrew Root notes on Paul Anlietner's podcast that the Mainline church has hit a wall. The clergy no longer has any role in the modern world. How did this happen? \n\n\n\nWe'll follow the Charles Taylor/Max Weber analysis of secularity all the way up to Sam Harris and Bret Weinstein. Basically if you guy the anthropology of blind Darwinian evolution of the genetic and culture track we wind up with Sam Harris' patch. The same science that tells us we must have religion to experience meaning and purpose tells us that all religion is a mind trick, a trick of perception. Where do we go from here? \n\n2:06 - Accountability timestamp\n2:18 - Ancient Technology Clip \n5:04 - Evolution of Spiritual Politics\n7:37 - Story of the Bible\n8:45 - Deism Sammich\n13:13 - Darwin comes along\n16:34 - Purpose in Priestcraft\n17:53 - Myth of Progress\n20:44 - Cultural Telomeres (when he sees it)\n22:24 - totally not snark - \n24:11 - 19th century philosophy\n25:15 - yon Pastoral Sword - \n27:38 - kindler gentler idea economy\n30:11 - Hurry Up Andrea\n31:25 - Veil of Forgetting\n31:38 - it's pronounced the other way\n32:33 - pattern monkeying - \n34:52 - hermeneutics of suspicion\n38:12 - Vanderklay's way of saying LARP\n40:13 - the root of it\n41:01 - Gambler Karaoke\n42:05 - that's my point\n42:45 - insert caption\n44:55 - LARP with feeling\n49:35 - 5 blind guys and an elephant\n52:11 - Seeking Sacred\n\nAndrew Root Faith Formation in a Secular Age https://amzn.to/2FSFeRx\nAndrew Root Pastor in a Secular Age https://amzn.to/2ZStFkk\nCharles Taylor A Secular Age https://amzn.to/3mFbLLS\nThe Metaphysical Club https://amzn.to/2ZZXaB2\nBret Weinstein Rebel Wisdom Assassin Robots Quote https://youtu.be/KigJ5rn-4yE\nBret Weinstein Alistair McGrath Unbelievable https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nDavid Sloan Wilson and Gad Saad https://youtu.be/zXcU6qPcVvE\nAndrea with the Bangs Ryan Bennett https://youtu.be/z3TCy8X_0bw\nAndrea, Jonathan Pageau, https://youtu.be/P5qB6ezOQdY\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
