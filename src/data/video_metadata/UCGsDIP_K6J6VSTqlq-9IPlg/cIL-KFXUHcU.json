 "description": "We are commanded to not bear false witness against our neighbors. The Heidelberg Catechism broadens this to both speak the truth AND not injure our neighbors good name. This seems particularly difficult when we are split along ideological and political lines. Jesus did it, in the midst of a culture war hotter and more bloody than our own.\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
