 "description": "Joseph grew up very Catholic. He's of Italian and Mexican heritage. Went to a Jesuit HS and then into the California UC system. He was a history major but built up student debt so had to go into manufacturing like his father. The faith wasn't his young and he went full materialist atheist in college. Via Jordan Peterson he began to reconsider. He's a very thoughtful, reflective man and so we talk. \n\nUCLA and UCSC History major\nStudent debt\nItalian sycilian mexican\nRaised very Catholic\nLoyola HS in LA\nHughes and Boeing\nAcademic to manufacturing environment\nSatellite production\nLatent hostility to Christianity\nStalinist purges\nHeavy metal fan\nTattoos\nJordan Peterson\nAlign how I act with what I consume and what i say I believe\nHold those reactions in check\nStrong sense of prudence and caution\nAlign towards a Christian orientation\nOatmeal of Christian practice\nPredestination\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
