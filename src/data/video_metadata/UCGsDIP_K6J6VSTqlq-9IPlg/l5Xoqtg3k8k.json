 "date": "2021-04-16",
 "description": "With the ubiquity of discordant voices and multiplicity of platforms finding a basis for community is increasingly difficult. Church numbers are falling and any consensus on a sexual ethic is evaporating. It is likely that what will arise will be something like a new Benedict-option monasticism for highly motivated and disciplined Christians, but how will the rest of the church fair? \n\nRussell Moore Newsletter https://erlcemailcommunication.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/r/6C1451630A966B6D2540EF23F30FEDED/5FDF8DACC1A48EAA13FFE994E815FA5E\nI don't owe you... https://thepostcalvin.com/i-dont-owe-you-sht/\nDoes it matter? https://thepostcalvin.com/does-it-matter/\nBuilding a New Christian Sexual Ethic https://mikeinsac.com/2020/01/22/building-a-new-christian-sexual-ethic/\nHe asked permission to touch but not to ghost https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/style/modern-love-he-asked-permission-to-touch-but-not-to-ghost.html\nProtestantism Calvinism Monasticism https://paulvanderklay.me/2021/04/15/protestantism-calvinism-and-monasticism/\nGod is Grey Baby https://youtu.be/7DGJBilTS1M\n\nDiscord link.
