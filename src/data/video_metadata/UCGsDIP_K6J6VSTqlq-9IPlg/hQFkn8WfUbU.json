No service. No family gatherings. We're used to a celebration and instead because of COVID its just more isolation. \n\nDoes this calamity surprise us? Stephen Jenkinson who was a hospice counselor notes that Western culture inculcates a culture of surprise and denial at misfortune and death, but death is inevitable and should be expected. \n\nCS Lewis in Life in an Atomic Age wonders what kind of world we thought we were living in. If there is only \"Nature\" then our doom is sure. \n\nLewis also notes, however, that what we are talking about when we talk about Jesus' resurrection is not just the unwinding of Nature, but it's renovation and rejuvenation. Humpty Dumpty doesn't just fall from the wall, the wall and Humpty will be remade and this gives us hope. \n\nStephen Jenkinson Death https://youtu.be/_m3f79PvBXU\nWeinsteins Video https://youtu.be/xkuw8dDAThA\nCS lewis Miracles https://amzn.to/3aWLX7H\nCS Lewis The Last Battle https://amzn.to/3b480t9\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
