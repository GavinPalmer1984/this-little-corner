Jesus has displayed miraculous power which leads people to anticipate divine intervention on Israel's behalf against Roman oppression. As he makes his way to Jerusalem the mob grows and anticipates Jesus taking leadership and leading them against the Empire and Herod's puppet regime. At the last minute men burst in with breaking news that Pilate has shed the blood of their countrymen while they were in the act of sacrificing to their God. NOW is the time for Jesus to embrace the cause, turn the multitude into an army and right the wrongs.\n\nKenneth Bailey Poet and Peasant https://amzn.to/3r52Ip6\nThe Banner \"Christian Insurgency\" article https://www.thebanner.org/columns/2021/02/reflections-on-a-christian-insurrection\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
