I couldn't think about this story of Hezekiah's prayer and not think about how it has all the reactive bits in the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson conversation. I have a lot of sympathy for Sam on this one, but in the end I'm a Calvinist and God gets to do with us as he chooses. \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean
