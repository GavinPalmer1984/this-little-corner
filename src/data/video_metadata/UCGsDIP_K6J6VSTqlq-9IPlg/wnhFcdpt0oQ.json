What kind of thing are we actually talking about in terms anyone can understand? Transformations of many varieties happen in nature and in humanity. We seek positive examples of it. Addiction is a negative example. What can we learn about transformations even before we dig into the specific reasons Rhett and Link self-identify for their transformations? Let's begin the conversation here. \n\nRhett and Link Lost Years https://youtu.be/hYCgz-MiNE4\nRhett and Link Missionary Years https://youtu.be/2_5PG-cl9WE\nRhett's Deconstruction https://youtu.be/1qbna6t1bzw\nLink's Deconstruction https://youtu.be/w1AZhlyoD9s\n\nDaniel Bonevac Scientific Image vs Manifest Image https://youtu.be/aVoWTnpF5ew\nEvery Story is the Same https://youtu.be/LuD2Aa0zFiA\nWhy Bret Weinstein and Sam Harris Keep Tripping Over Free Will https://youtu.be/5dm7lTDdBOg\nMichelle Williams Golden Globe Speech https://youtu.be/Gj-r0tcvLh8\nCNN Transcript https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/05/entertainment/michelle-williams-golden-globes-2020-speech/index.html\nJohn Vervaeke Awakening from the Meaning Crisis 13 Buddhism and Addiction https://youtu.be/vGB8k7jk1AQ\nMemoirs of an Addicted Brain https://amzn.to/2SQG5pX\nJordan Peterson and David Nasser One Last Question https://youtu.be/afSQZweYDts\nReligion: Chimps banging on Puzzle Boxes https://youtu.be/rMdmG-X-gUs\nAaron Rodges Religion Youtube https://youtu.be/ciFl-zxy9PM\nDanica Patrick Podcast with Aaron Rodgers https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aaron-rodgers/id1465014169?i=1000460790130\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
