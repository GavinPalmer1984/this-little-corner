He sees woke evangelicals and woke atheists who are religious and he wonders if there is a connection. \n\nI see a connection but different from his. It is a modernist/post-modern split. I think modernism (like Sam Harris) has a problem with knowledge. They tend to see propositional truth as the only truth. So I walk through some Peterson stuff, some Vervaeke stuff and show how in fact secularism has pressured \"progressive evangelicals\" into a more secular eschatology. Well meaning people are hopping on the Critical Theory moral signaling train because for them the price is cheap. Lots of stuff in this video. \n\nPodcast where Boghossian brings out the idea
