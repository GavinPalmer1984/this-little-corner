 "description": "Two weeks ago John Van Donk and I spoke with Clay Libolt about the Reformational Biblical interpretation in the context of the upcoming Human Sexuality report in the CRCNA. This time John brought together two friends for a conversation about more practical matters relating to the denomination. Doug Vande Griend is a lawyer who has extensive experience in the CRCNA at the nexus of the law and the church order. Dale Feikema is the \"House Steward\" of John's local church. We being talking about some legal things but the conversation eventually pursues whether or not the CRCNA has a mission today. \n\nJohn Van Donk Playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78jrJ66xdkU&list=PLYSXopxC8Z9v6ntQs870UewdmfDqqLOm2\n\nCRCNA Human Sexuality Report https://www.crcna.org/sites/default/files/human_sexuality_report_2021.pdf\nCRC-Voices Listserve https://groups.io/g/crc-voices\n\nSubstack Video Summary https://paulvanderklay.substack.com/p/should-we-initiate-the-crcna-end\n\nNotes: \n\nHuman Sexuality CRC Report: will create discussion and perhaps animosity, division in the CRCNA. \n\nThere was a seminary in search of a denomination: Mid-America Seminary\n\nThese guys are loyal to a denomination that no longer exists\n\nWhat is the institutional church\n\nWhat was the purpose of the CRC denomination: two divinely ordained missions: provide a nurturing, safe, comfortable place for Dutch immigrants, help the assimilate.
