It's a way of practicing intimacy and authenticity in conversation which you will see him practice in this conversation. This is a guy with which you can really have a satisfying conversation. \n\nOur first conversation where he shares his story https://youtu.be/7dshAsIDP7I\n\nGuy's channel  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhoymQ9glku30sG4qgW-iQ \n\nNotes \nMarriage\nIt didn\u2019t provide a relationship\nSecure attachment\nThe world shows up different\nThought that freedom was supposed to be the mandala\nThe obsession with preserving it at some level\nThe sacrifice is giving up the guarding of the individual freedom\nGuy, and what he\u2019s inside of\nWisdom \nNear death experience\nThe whole game has changed but it\u2019s not apparent how strange it is\nYou go on a dating site, you go on interviews\nIt\u2019s a different understanding of what a self is and what a relationship is\nThe self will be constituted by that relationship\nWe don\u2019t see a future, a telos but a thing to optimize\nAn age in which we\u2019ve lost any sense of home\nSense of deep familiarity\nIn the danger is the saving power\nThe age of technology\nWe don\u2019t produce history\nIt\u2019s not an object of my production\nReally SEE it\nDevelop it beyond itself\nDeep intelligibility\nBeing with what is\nTo be alive is to be in trouble at some level\nWe can\u2019t attain it. \nYearning\nImplicit is a homelessness\nThe pleasure of the inferior\nSistine chapel, the fingers don\u2019t touch\nThe agony and the ecstasy\nOur innate homelessness allows for the importance of home to be important but never achieved\nCS Lewis Mere Christianity https://amzn.to/3996O6g\nWalter Wangarin Crafting Your Marriage to Last https://amzn.to/3996O6g (the marriage book PVK referred to).\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
