Here is an invitation if you'd like to join. https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nI usually do these on Friday mornings 10am Pacific for 2 hours. We take posted questions and voiced questions. \n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:00 What should be the limits of doubt and questioning within the church? \n18:30 Karl Rahner The Christian of the future will be a mystic will not exist at all\n23:30 Modernism and NT Wright, Epistemology of Love https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/02/loving-to-know\n31:00  What was the key message you took away from Vervaeke's Awakening from the Meaning Crisis\n36:45 Any thoughts on how to successfully reintegrate consciousness into the system?\n--This is what Barfield was getting at\n--We need a consciousness wider than the consciousness of our own islanded egos\n--One of the attractions of mindfulness meditation is that it attempts to make consciousness of our consciousness (and its workings) part of our daily life \n--There was a whole tradition of Christian meditation, self-examination (confession), contemplation of Gd, via purgatoria, teachings by people like John of the Cross. Could this be brought into the 21st century in a Vervaekian manner, or like the recent revival/adaptation of stoicism?\n55:00 Aquinas: Edward Feser Aaron Two faculties: the intellect and the will. Post-modernism is that the will is primary, rather than the intellect. \n1:03:30 Is there a difference between \"What is sin?\" in the Old Testament time vs. New Testament time?? Do people in the Bible see, view and understand \"sin\" as same or did it \"evolve\" through the time? Thank you for your time.\n1:14:00 Strongest relationships with co-workers. In tensions with church fellowship. \n1:25:10 Have you seen any of the Dark Stoa videos on The Stoa? \n1:25:47 Have you ever encountered tension between 'church or ministry as an institution' versus the truth seeking and embodied love that comes with following Christ? How do you think about and resolve such tensions?\n1:36:00 The conversation around truth seeking vs market forces seems core to how we might describe or understand the IDW. Could the same paradigm be said of the ILW? \n1:42:45 Gnosticism in contemporary life\n1:45:25 How do you interpret \" do not conform to the patterns of this world\"  \n1:56 Why do you take cheap shots at Donald Trump? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
