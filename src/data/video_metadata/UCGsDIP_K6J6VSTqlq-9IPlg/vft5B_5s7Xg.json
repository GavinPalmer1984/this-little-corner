 "description": "Benjamin Boyce grew his YouTube channel revealing the Evergreen College mayhem that led to the departure of Bret Weinstein. He sits down with me to explore some of the dynamics of critical theory turned religion (Woke Religion or as I call it Progressive Liberationism). At various points I'll refer to his conversation with James Lindsay https://youtu.be/TFBWyCcwZK4\n\nThis is the same conversation recorded on a different camera angle on Benjamin's channel. https://youtu.be/lN3u2B769nI \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
