 "description": "The Good Place worked to teach Philosophy in a sitcom, but couldn't help expose our deep assumptions about what a good life is and what a good person might be. Dallas Willard in his book The Divine Conspiracy made the should-be obvious point that Jesus entered into this debate about what is a good Person in his Sermon on the Mount. Jesus began with Beatitudes, a declaration of about fortune easily found in the Psalms. Beatitudes in the Psalms are exactly what standard religious dictates. Do the right things and God will reward you. Jesus' beatitudes are radically different. Jesus life was radically different. He made that point without denying, however, the point he was contrasting. That was Jesus. \n\nthe Philosophy of the Good Place https://youtu.be/stHk4_VePds\nWhat Japanese think of religions https://youtu.be/7gZHuFtuzdg\nThe Divine Conspiracy https://amzn.to/2RRrWZj\nDominion by Tom Holland https://amzn.to/3b0otyV\nThe Shadow of the Sword https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Sword-Birth-Global-Empire-ebook/dp/B005IEGKMA\nSoul Searching https://amzn.to/2OjTxQF\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
