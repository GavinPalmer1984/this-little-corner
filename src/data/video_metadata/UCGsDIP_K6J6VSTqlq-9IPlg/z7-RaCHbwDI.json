How would you judge?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7-RaCHbwDI", "date": "2021-07-10", "description": "John Vervaeke had a terrific conversation with Nick and the first question came up about John Vervaeke's relationship with Christianity. The answer was fascinating. But the context for the questions and the answers is even more fascinating. Why does Jesus have such a good reputation in our culture? Why would non-Christians call others who don't necessarily identify as Christians as being the best Christians they know? \n\nThe Rest is History Podcast https://pca.st/dljf8nbm\n\nBridges of Meaning Q/A with John Vervaeke https://youtu.be/xSSiBR5N49E\n\nDiscord link.
