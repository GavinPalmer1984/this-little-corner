Can we navigate without guiding stars outside the iron box of secularism? Jordan Peterson and Steven Pinker begin talking how nations can resist ethno-nationalism but Peterson quickly brings in Ben Shapiro and his claims about a Judeo-Christian tradition as essential for understanding the Enlightenment project. \n\nTom Holland's new book Dominion is about to be published and his research brought him to some new realizations about the root of the West's assumed morality. Secularity is in many ways Christianity lite in the West but can it hold if divorced from its roots? \n\nJBP and Steven Pinker https://youtu.be/pBylbB7s5Nw\nVervaeke Religion of No Religion https://youtu.be/440NV0eer00\nFatal Discord https://amzn.to/2phrc3S\nAbolition of Man https://amzn.to/2NlQQwo\nThe Problem of Pain https://amzn.to/2Wh6qxB\nSapiens https://amzn.to/31T29BE\nMaps of Meaning https://amzn.to/2MTSmqF\n12 Rules for Life https://amzn.to/2pWIEed\nBen Shapiro the Right Side of History https://amzn.to/36boWfj\nTom Holland and Glen Scrivener https://youtu.be/a0xCs2EfiXA\nDelingpod 35 with Tom Holland https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nDominion by Tom Holland https://amzn.to/367agOp\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
