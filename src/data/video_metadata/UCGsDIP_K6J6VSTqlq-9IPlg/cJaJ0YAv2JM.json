 "description": "I met (virtually) with Nuance Forum and got a question I regularly get. \"What do you think about same-sex marriage?\" People want a yes/no answer or a minute answer and that never satisfies me. First because my answer doesn't matter. People's beliefs on this are already deeply baked in by a myriad of inputs that have far more influence than I. I decided to make at least one, and maybe more videos about this as a way of exploring a number of issues about the Bible, morality and why these aren't easy answers for Christians or churches. I suspect many of my responses will not satisfy many in this polarized debate but I think the subject deserves more attention than shouting and politicking. Depending on how this is received I might do more. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
