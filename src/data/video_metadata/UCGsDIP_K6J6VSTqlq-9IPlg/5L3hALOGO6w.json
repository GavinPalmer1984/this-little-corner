 "description": "Last week we took a look at 1 Thessalonians 1-3 which is a passionate picture into Paul's developing a fledgling church in Thessalonica. This week we look at the admonition regarding sexual immorality as Paul admonishes them to \"possess their vessel\". This isn't a random attempt at controlling men's bodies, it's in line with Israel's alternative vision of how the universe works.\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
