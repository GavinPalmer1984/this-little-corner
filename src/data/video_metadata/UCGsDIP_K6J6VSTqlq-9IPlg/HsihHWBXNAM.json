Garry taught and works in arts and design and shares with me what he thinks. \n\nConversation notes\nJordan Peterson\nMeaning Making\nGraphic Symbolism\nPageau is talking about subject matter\nThere are a lot of artists that follow and there\u2019s a reason for that\nThere\u2019s a formal aspect for that. \nInteresting content,\nAll these stories are a way to get into the non-physical way of getting at meaning\nWe don\u2019t know how to really get at that, to define and solidify those\nDesigners and artists pull meaning out of things and imbue meaning into things\nWhen you\u2019re building art and design there are formal elements and principles, things in the phenomenon itself, line, shape, space, color. It\u2019s not subjective. \nIn art design they are making meaning and how they do it\nRed for sex, passion, romance, lust\nTweek the meaning of the color with another element\nConnect that non-physical thing through the physical thing\nThey\u2019ve put in more concrete terms something previously felt in an ambiguous way\nBook: Ten books that screwed up the world and 5 more that didn\u2019t help\nFrancis Schaeffer\n\nTen Books that Screwed Up the World and Five that didn't help. https://amzn.to/30cGyIw\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
