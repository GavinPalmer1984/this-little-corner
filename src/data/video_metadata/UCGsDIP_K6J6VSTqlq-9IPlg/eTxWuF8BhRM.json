The Pharisees were a moderate religious-political party that was trying to resist the spiritual contamination of their culture through what today would be seen as symbolic resistance. They notice that Jesus' disciples are not observant/compliant and they ask Jesus about that. What Jesus says to them offends, disturbs and changes the world in a Barfieldian way. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
