We think some combination of power and reason will bring us all to the utopia we imagine we deserve, and it never happens. Right in the middle of the story we sleepwalk into the resurrection of the Son of Man. This has been reliably changing the world for 2000 years. Do we wish to try it. \n\nDominion by Tom Holland https://amzn.to/3mg1Ix7\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
