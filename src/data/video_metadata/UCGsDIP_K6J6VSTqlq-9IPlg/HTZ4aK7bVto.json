He always brings a lot of terrific insights and fresh ideas. Here are the notes. \n\nSam\n\nMoral Evil vs natural evil\n\nMalcom Guite link https://malcolmguite.wordpress.com/2020/05/18/the-seventh-poem-in-my-corona-on-the-psalms/\nCOVID19 as natural evil\n\nMoral evil as weakness \n\nLess inclined to see the disobedience as the the thing\n\nIncompetence\u2026\n\nJulian conversation https://youtu.be/ucjss0bm8lo\n\nLuke conversation https://youtu.be/tbQE4YuquQI\n\n4 P\u2019s Vervaeke need to be taken wholistically https://paulvanderklay.me/2020/01/10/vervaeke-4-ps-of-knowing-via-surok-on-discord/\n\nCigarette smoking\n\nSam Harris\n\nDavid Bentley Hart on Beauty https://amzn.to/2LM4fxB\n\nEric Weinstein\u2026 \n\n19th century education was about developing taste\n\nTeaching taste was undermined by losing the canon\n\nDeveloping the skill to recognize quality (Sevilla) \n\nWe need to get back to rhetoric rather than expository, talks about it as violence, impressing upon his audience as a sort of restraint. A normative command. He argues for going to rhetoric. Arguments that are aesthetic. The reason to choose something is that it has quality. \n\nThe christian faith is the one that is better, it\u2019s the beautiful. \n\nJordan Peterson believe in God\n\nDeconstructed Eric\u2019s conversation\n\nAndrew Root: secular age\n\nNaive belief\n\nNaive secularism\n\nNew atheists come up because the secular frame has become problematic\n\nNo apologists for a naive view. As soon as you see an apologist you know the frame is problematized. \n\nThe secular frame has become problematized. That is a new phase. \n\nRoger Scruton\n\nBob Dylan All along the Watchtower\n\nLincoln\u2019s second inaugural\n\nTaNahasi Coates\n\nML King Jr. vision\n\nMissing historical perspective\n\nLSOO\n\nRevenant analysis\n\nLogosMadeFlesh\n\nJames KA Smith \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
