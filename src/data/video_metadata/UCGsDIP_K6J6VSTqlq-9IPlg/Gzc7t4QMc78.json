 "description": "A lot of people ask me if or when I think Jordan Peterson will be back on the public stage. I tell them all that I have no idea. I don't know Jordan personally. I have no source of information about him apart from what is publicly known and I don't seek it out. He has a right to privacy and we should respect that. \n\nThere is a lot of anxiety out there about Jordan and so I thought I'd make a video of unsolicited advice that would be my wishlist for what his flourishing into a second wave of influence could look like. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
