We talked about how Jordan Peterson opened up a space for these conversations where we address the meaning crisis. We talked about meetups and how churches can make space for helpful conversations for dialogos and processing. We talked some church and Western history. We played with a lot of Latin words to hopefully find ways to talk about some things without triggering less productive long-standing debates. \n\nJohn Vervaeke's Channel https://www.youtube.com/user/johnvervaeke\nAwakening from the Meaning Crisis https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
