 "description": "William Lane Craig and Roger Penrose were on Unbelievable. Penrose pointed out three mysteries in the world which could be associated with three realms: mind, matter and math. How do the three relate? William Lane Craig postulated that matter and math could most easily be derived from the realm of mind than any other configuration. Penrose was hesitant. It was clear that they were sniffing at God and religion, but why the pause? Both the path and the pause were vitally important. Penrose couldn't postulate so comfortably apart from what Charles Taylor calls the Buffered Self. Rene Girard notes that behind secularism in the West is Christianity but we are in denial about it. CS Lewis believed that the story of the incarnation was the missing piece that helps the whole story make sense. \nUnbelievable William Lane Craig and Roger Penrose https://youtu.be/9wLtCqm72-Y\nRene Girard CBC 5 https://youtu.be/wimFvlhKQcU\nRene Girard Cayley Book https://amzn.to/31Z2MdC\nCharles Taylor A Secular Age https://amzn.to/30YFkfe\nCS Lewis The Grand Miracle Pt. 1 https://youtu.be/Uv4kx2QP4UM\nCS Lewis The Grand Miracle Pt. 2 https://youtu.be/k0QpxSDAluU\nMcGrew Deism https://youtu.be/JV98H21OFh8\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
