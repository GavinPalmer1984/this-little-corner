Not everything has to be a fight.\n2. It's OK to not know. \n3. We're all burned out on like, share and subscribe. The real-ness of the gritty randos conversations is refreshing. \n4. The church is a VERY BIG place. \n\nConversation notes: \nWhy am I still watching Paul after 3 years? \n\nNot necessarily the content, it is the shape of how you do it\n\nAlister Roberts, Glen Scrivener, The Randos\n\nWhat is that thing? \n\n 1. Not everything has to be a fight\n 2. It's OK not to know\n  a. A lot of people are weary about having to fight or having to know, Everyone is trying to build their brand, recruit you to their tribe. That grace to not have to double down on things. \n  b. Eventually you will need lines. Finding where those lines are. How shall I then live. \n  c. Questions of hierarchy. What it is that they are so into about that. It's OK to not have those lines out here where the river, the creek, the swamp, not have the fight and the hard lines.\n 3. We're all worn out on like-share and subscribe. Real-ness, people burned out on social media culture, it's refreshing. \n 4. The church is a VERY big place\u2026\n \n Fatal Discord\n \n The symbolism of the exodus moved throughout the Bible\n \n 10 Minute Bible Hour: Different churches of different traditions. \n \n I don't know as much as I thought I did, and I'm less sure about some things that I was, I'm less sure of pushing my own ideas. Less willing to build a brand. \n \n Less uncertain that I really want to keep doing this Jesus thing. \n \n \n \n He's done a work in my heart that I cannot undo. \n \n People have de-stabilized me in some important ways. It was never me to get into\n \n These were not what was holding me up to begin with. \n \n Closing Question\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
