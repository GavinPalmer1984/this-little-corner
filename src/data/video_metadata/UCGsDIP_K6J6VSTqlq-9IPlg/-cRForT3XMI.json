 "description": "The Exodus is the touchstone of distinguishing the hopes of humanity to end endemic, common oppression and the true path to liberation. Israel is bound in slavery but the script of the City of Man offers no permanent solution. Moses begins as a would-be liberator like Sargon of Akkad but fails. How will a living God unseat not only one example of common human oppression but also the pattern itself. \n\n\n\n  Zondervan's Illustrated Bible Background Commentary https://amzn.to/3iqx4Op \n\n\n\n  Great Courses Books the Matter City of God https://amzn.to/2PzRCaT \n\n\n\n  Through the Eye of the Needle https://amzn.to/3ksQeEU \n\n John Brown Midnight rising https://amzn.to/3ip8Xjc \n\n  Debt, the first 5000 years https://amzn.to/3aeQuCT \n\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
