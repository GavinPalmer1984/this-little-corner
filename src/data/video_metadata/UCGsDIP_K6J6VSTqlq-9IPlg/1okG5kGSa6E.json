Notes below. \nDomicide\n\nCovid 19\n\nReligiosity and WWII\n\nEverything was relative to our subjectivity\n\nNot very deep, not very powerful resources, \n\nHow spontaneously mythological thinking is emerging around this. \n\nZak stein, the war on heaven on medium\n\nCrisis krisis judgment\n\nBarely implicit narrative that people have\n\nThe fool says in his heart there is no covid\n\nArchetypal mythopoetic stuff\n\nCrazy conspiracy theories, narrative order behind the chaos\n\nReligious illiteracy that is exacerbating this\n\nCapacity for a literate and wise response to the mythopoetic machinery\n\nWe are largely suffering it rather than making use of it. We need to reconsider what it is that our education is in the service of. \n\nCulture collapsed to the normativity of the market. The market isn\u2019t the right machine. Behaving poorly in all of this. We need to understand to educating other normativities other than the market. \n\nDialectic, dialogos project, the language that people were bringing to this trying to bring back, renew the use of religious terms. \n\n\n\nFaith is needed, what does faith mean\n\nDescarte did something about subjectivity. Descarte equates soul and conscious mind. That moment where consciousness touches itself, you see the identifications take place, the sense of soul, what it is in Plato, as intermediary between , it\u2019s the faculty that mediates between transcendence and immanence, \n\nNew language. Moreness, an inexhaustible more-ness. Such-ness. Uniqueness to you, irreplacable to you. \n\nTillich, moreness is a way of talking about the mystery we participate in, and the such-ness is the mystery of individuation. Always in a constant tension. The soul is the capacity that constantly mediates between them. \n\nTrying to get into right relationship with themself and reality. This way of talking is coming to the fore. \n\nSearching for lost faculties. Backgrounded, suppressed, marginalized.  \n\nFaith as the wedding of emergence of mind to the emergence of world that affords right relationship\n\nWhat is the faculty that does that. \n\nSpirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse\n\nThree non-propositional P\u2019s\n\nThe faculty of faith and finesse\n\nCalvinism\n\nPhilia sophia\n\nReduce deception, deep connectedness\n\nSoul, mediating tension\n\nCs lewis\n\nThe ontological argument\n\nSecular version of the ontological argument\n\nTwo people can get to places they couldn\u2019t get to on their own\n\nPerson is a bad translation Hypostasis\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
