 "description": "I was only here for half the show. Tommy and Freddie recorded the musical portion while I was busy. Then we did the usual interview separate. We had the information on the NBA Playoffs wrong. Oh well. If you get your news from the Freddie and Paul show you might want to consider your choices. :)",
