 "description": "This was supposed to be a short comment on the start of the James Fox Higgins and Jonathan Pageau conversation https://youtu.be/p2LK5T2SVqU but I got busy and on my drive out to Costco I watched the whole thing. That meant that the Powerpoint I made earlier this morning really didn't fit so I wound up talking about Calvinism and how Peterson is a gateway drug and materialism and even included my dog. So this is one hour of stream of consciousness rambling butting into a very lovely conversation I wasn't invited into. I hate to waste it so watch it if you want to. :)",
