 "description": "A new Discord channel is operating to study the work of John Vervaeke. You can join it at this link.  https://discord.gg/MXxRcmv\n\nTheir Youtube channel is here. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMjfLBUjqy9EJUaLyOeMiA\n\nThey invited me to do a Question and Answer and this is the recording. \n\nQuestions and notes\n1. PVK personal introduction into conversation\n\n2. My pluralism comment with my last conversation with John\n\n3. spirituality\nFather was LDS and said must have these things. \ncommunity\nritual\nauthority\nworldview\nspirituality: what makes things move\n\n4. how to reenter christianity\n\n5. Mark LeFevere two worlds mythology\n\n6. The goracle: Glory, grace and the Holy Spirit\n\n7. Jacob: religion that's not a religion The God idea\n\n8. Sin as feature vs. bug. Religion without religion. human iniquity and dissonance \n\n9. Golden tipped Pen: God #1 and God #2 \nHi Paul, I recently just watched a podcast in where you mentioned your concepts of God 1 and God 2. A question that I have is how do you characterize and differentiate particular intelligent design (such as natural selection and central pattern generators) versus more wholistic, phenomenological, gestalt-esque components of God (such as the salience landscape and relevance realization)? Does the difference lie in a matter of scale\n\n10. Nick B. Handling disagreement and focus. Why has Bridges of Meaning been able to hold this tension so well so far? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
