 "description": "On the Bridges of Meaning Discord Server we've been playing around with conversation mixtures and topics. This is the second \"Randomizing Randos\" attempt where we gather three individuals who have had significant experience and in some cases deconstruction from Pentecostal churches. Some of them are now investigating Orthodoxy. All have been blessed by the work of Jonathan Pageau. The four of us chat for an hour and a half and then we open it up for questions from the Discord server. \n\nJonathan Pageau's work https://thesymbolicworld.com/\nMy conversation with JP Marceau and John Vervaeke about Miracles https://youtu.be/GCeHJtdQ0fg\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
