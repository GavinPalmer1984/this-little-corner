What was Jesus doing? \n\n(For more on the sex habits of the early Caesars see https://www.patheos.com/blogs/catholicauthenticity/2015/07/the-gay-roman-emperor-gene/) \nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
