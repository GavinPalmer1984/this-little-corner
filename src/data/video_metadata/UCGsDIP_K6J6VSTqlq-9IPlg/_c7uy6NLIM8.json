If everyone is acting like children..\n\nHow we got here series\n\nBeing a child is the standard adult\u2026\n\nPeople don\u2019t know how to mature. \n\nPascal, the thought about distraction, in Pensees\n\nNow the clown can\u2019t distract you anymore\n\nJuvenilzation, adoltescence, emerging adulthood\n\nGeeks and fans\n\nMath geek, film geek\n\nGeek comes from carnival performers, often alcoholics, a created freak, \n\nMonster Midway, Lindsay Greshem, Joy Davidson\u2019s first husband, Nightmare Alley from Carny lingo into the popular culture\n\nSwallowing forbidden things. \n\nIngesting anything related to your obsession, \n\nVeggie tales as \u201cas long as it communicates the message\u201d, but does it? \n\nCute, big-eyed things don\u2019t predate before Mickey Mouse\n\nBefore then you didn\u2019t find these big eyed cute things\u2026\n\nThe perfect way to smuggle messages\n\nBe true to yourself from Shakespeare, was full of himself and a liar\n\nHead canon, \u201cin my head canon I see spiderman being like this\u201d \n\nLeonard Bernstein on TV teaching people about Bach or Beethoven\n\nThe great illusion is that it isn\u2019t their bubble at all\n\nWhen everyone\u2019s a child and no one\u2019s an adult, it means that the adults can do what they want\n\nIDW\n\nYou don\u2019t have to work for them\n\nDivide and conquer\n\nYou needed your slave and serfs to be adults\n\nJBP was getting people to watch 2.5 lectures on the bible and go through the whole series, speaks of a deep hunger\n\nMaybe we\u2019ve crossed something\u2026\n\nKidulting\n\nMeaning, if things don\u2019t mean anything. Why read more if what you\u2019re reading doesn\u2019t produce meaning. \n\nThe machine learns how to market and package these things back to you. You have the imitation of meaning. There\u2019s a real cult-like quality to pop culture. But unlike the cults of the 70s with a devious but charismatic leader. Our cults tend to not have leaders. \n\nToday\u2019s pop cults are much more like Cargo-cults. \n\nThey\u2019ve tapped into the ancestors. How do we reproduce this. \n\nFandom has this aspect of the cargo cult. How do we get back the feeling of the Lord of the Rings, \n\nThey bear a resemblance to real meaning what the islanders bear to flight strips and \n\nThese are illusions of meaning. Not the real thing. \n\nDefects in human created realities. \n\nSuperstition is rife. \n\nDon\u2019t know how to take life seriously, so instead they take it ironically\n\nPhilosophical
