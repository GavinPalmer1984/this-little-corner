Byrne Power repaired it. I had decided to abandon it for another attempt at treating the JOKER but since I didn't have a video to post today and Byrne gracious fixed it why not share it. \n\nSo Eric Weinstein's portal is sort of the Batcave and Peter Thiel is sort of a Bruce Wayne. They want to save decaying Gotham (now on the West Coast) The problem is that what they (and Rationality Rules) are dealing with is not the world as modernism imagines. Modernism is crumbling and the titans of the world are trying to find the next great thing. Meanwhile the sheep are reasonably anxious about their future. \n\nJonathan Pageau Joker video https://youtu.be/H74BbcTs6xs\nEric Weinstein and Peter Thiel https://youtu.be/nM9f0W2KD5s\nRationality Rules Facts are Not Enough https://youtu.be/iviDRNPE6N8\nWhy people don't believe climate science https://youtu.be/y2euBvdP28c\nDr. Jim Manifest vs Scientific Image https://youtu.be/q1yIjoIy3Fk\nVervaeke 39 https://youtu.be/440NV0eer00\nJeff Quackenbush Conversation https://youtu.be/8NDOFWtL0XA\nByrne Power on Joker https://youtu.be/-4rvQWhVvbA\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
