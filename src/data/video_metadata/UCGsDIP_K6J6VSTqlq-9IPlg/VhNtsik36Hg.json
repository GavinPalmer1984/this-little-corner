The question was whether ancient people \"believed\" in their mythological gods like contemporary religious people \"believe\" in God. It's actually a difficult question on lots of levels. I wasn't sure of exactly what we'd talk about and I didn't know if I was helpful so I thought I'd take some time to walk through some of the complexity. \n\n\n\nAdam Friended and PSA Sitch livestream https://youtu.be/oEq44yiZ4H8\nSteven D Smith the Pagan City Secularism https://youtu.be/W9I9sVUta5s\nSteven Smith, Ross Douthat, Tara Isabel Burton AEI https://youtu.be/WIttJNroGyM\nWitchcraft and Christianity https://athenaeumreview.org/essay/managing-our-darkest-hatreds/\nTil We Have Faces CS Lewis https://amzn.to/2FzeYLX\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series 1 https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\nJordan Peterson Death and Resurrection of Jesus https://youtu.be/xPIanlF6IwM\nByrne Power Cargo Cults https://youtu.be/yuqtZVu4NBc\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
