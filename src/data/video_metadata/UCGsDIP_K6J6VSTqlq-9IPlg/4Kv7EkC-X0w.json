 "description": "We are continuing to try to refine the Q/A process on the discord server. After this recorded session we had quite a long conversation about the benefit of longer vs shorter answers, best practices, etc. Most requested that I keep posting these sessions but we didn't record questions when requested. Here is the recording from June 26 2020\n\n0:00 Continuing to figure out the best practices of PVK Q/A\n6:00 Thoughts on Jung, Christianity\n15:30 If you could actually have one rule that would be enforced with real \"church discipline\" with teeth so that it really did have more effect than making someone leave the church, what would it be?\n22:00 What about theological or propositional enforcement\n29:00 Entry requirements to being a Christian, what threshholds, computer software, minimum system requirements\n44:00 Dr. Greg Enriquez Guy Sengstock Circling \n47:45 Fowler Stages of Faith, Why don't I like them? \n56:30 Father's day sermon. Questions to Pastor Paul. I hope you are well Pastor Paul and I have a question in regards to the fatherhood.\n\nSo, last weekend was father's day and some friends of mine sent me a videos of pastors, speaking about fatherhood. I won't name pastors and here's a quote from a pastor. To quote:\n\"So all of you who say the 'father's don't matter', You need to change your philosophy on that, because fathers are very important particularly for boys. Because boys need something to reflect off on, to figure out what am I supposed to be when I get here, there or elsewhere. That's very important to understand that. Now, I know that your child's father might not have been a good husband BUT that doesn't always mean that he can't be a good father. Just like you're being a good mother, doesn't always make you a good wife.\" To end quote.\n\nMy friend, disagree with the pastor, saying that \"bad father is bad husband, it is not separate\" and this type of thinking (what the pastor said) will cause so much damage to the body of Christ.\n\nSo, my question to you pastor Paul, is there a nuance way to see this \"bad father = bad husband?\" Should there be an argument that \"bad father=bad husband\" isn't always the case? Or this is where we, as a individual, just have to draw a Hardline, there are no alternative views on this manner? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for your time.\n\nWarren Farrel \n\n1:03:30 Job: Gun to the head moments Corrie Ten Boom. \n\n1:11:40 What is the Christian\u2019s role in political systems which govern according to the consent of the governed? And by what means do you answer that question, given that the New Testament was written before the rise of representative republics?\n\n1:19:30 Why suicide bad?  I have one simple question for Paul.\nWhy is suicide bad? Why is there the third brother missing in the story of Cain and Abel? You don't have to be bitter about the world. You can still wish your brothers well and (try to) leave it\n\n1:29:45 Old Adam and New Adam. We are crowd sourced. Striving through life as a mutual affair. With whom am I curating my life? Even after sifting through the trustworthy arenas. The vertigo of how I think and feel about what I am and the day to day walk and breath in the old Adam. That kind of vertigo where I have all these prejudices. It is such a swing entering into a cult. Is Christianity in some ways hinting that we are creatures that are wonderfully suited and the proper personality is Christ. \n\n1:41:15 What advice would you give for dealing with friends and family that are unconscious devotees of the new intersectional religion? Which topics that we ask you about do you find your golden glimmering salience highlighter making your tongue the lightest and most animated?\n\n1:44:50 Liberation theology \n\n1:48:50 Pastor Paul, I've been wanting to ask you about something, I've explored for years now the freewill question, and I've come across that calvinists do not believe humanity has libertarian freewill, I wanted to know how you solve the problem that comes from not having freewill at all, and being able to sin\n\n1:52:30 I have recently been awakened by Trevor Noah mentioning Rousseau and Social Contract concepts that inspired the formation of the United States constitution and Enlightenment ideas.  It is an area of foundational principals that I am exploring now and I wondered if you had some thoughts on this or if Jordan Peterson on this.\n\n1:55:30 If we are to bear our crosses in this life (voluntarily suffer), then happiness is at best an appearance. What, then, should the sufferer strive for, internalize, or dream, when the goal of sanctification cannot include a faulty notion of happiness, that in this life which  cannot be represented. (My question if it's not too late)\n\n1:59:47 Can you speak on some of the differences between guarding our hearts and being fearful.\n\n2:00:00 what do you think of John Wesley? \n\nLink to the Discord server https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \nFridays 10am PDT",
