We were brought together by a wonderful Pastor, Paul VanderKlay who started making YouTube videos about Jordan Peterson and taking the time to talk to random people who were struggling through the journey.  We have grown to welcome over 1000 members. \n\nWe recently lost one of our own, suddenly.  He leaves behind a wife and six beautiful children.  He was a force to be reckoned with and had the insight of a prophet.  We loved him and we will miss him.\n\nPlease join us in this effort to remember Joe Cassity, better known as Voth.  A husband, a father and a dear friend \n\nVOTH'S WRITINGS TRANSCRIPT: \n\nWatered by sorrowful tears,\nHe unknowingly sprouts,\nHis delicate head rears,\nWill of future he touts.\nA hope from the lost.\n\nBelief is the nexus of humanity. Communication is nebulous. Like two drunken people trying to find each other in an echoing forest, shrouded by fog: we talk past each other, over each other, and through each other. It is so hard to understand.\n\nHow strange the world is,\nTo contemplate,\nParadoxical dilemmas,\nI navigate.\n\nWe are all unreliable narrators. We neither convey reality accurately to each other, nor to ourselves. We simply cannot. It is too complex under the weight of infinity. However, we believe what we believe about what we believe. This is how we navigate that complexity. However, belief is not Absolute Truth: it is just a lens. A lens that can be molded, adapted, or destroyed. Destruction is the worst.\n\nI think I know things,\nBut I do not. \nYet, I must take it on faith,\nFor the aught\n\nWhen Nietzsche declared God dead, he could see the cracks in that unifying lens. Now, it has been shattered into countless pieces. We each pick up a fleck of this shattered lens \u2014 a fleck just big enough to see ourselves. This feels like individuation approaching solipsism.\n\n\"If knowledge is power, then a God am I?\"\nYou believe that: I've got a bridge you can buy.\nFrameworks of knowledge\u2014delicate things,\nDon't look too close as one faithfully clings.\n\nTo say God is dead is to say the God-lens shattered into disunited moral decay. Nietzsche wrote cynical condescending words about morality. He acted as if he believed himself above it. However, one can see beneath his snarky prose that he felt lost and alone. He seemed to combat his fear by writing morality off as weakness of spirit, and religion as exhaustion. But, he was kidding himself.\n\n\nA painful burn, is for what I yearn,\nIn these thickets of blighted earth.\nIn ash I'll find, what's left behind,\nAnd I hope that thing is mirth.\n\nThis post-truth era Nietzsche sought was a paradoxical attempt to step backward into the future. He wanted to resuscitate dying unity by making a Kantian push at reinventing religion. However, he went insane when the fa\u00e7ade of his power politics came crashing down around him, as he tried to save a horse from its savage beating. What is my horse?\n\nWhat once was, could be undone in a flash,\nAnd all the things you knew\u2014only a splash.\nJust ripples on the abyss of the infinite,\nNow you're awash with curiosity like an infant.\n\nUnachievable, absolute, materialistic truth is not the answer. Disunited, solipsistic, diversity of belief is not the answer. Nihilistic, YOLO, consumerism is not the answer. Extreme, partisan, power politics is not the answer.\n\nWhat can the dog-headed one do with the weight of the world?\nI write them stories about themselves. \nAnd I will read to them if I have to.\n\nHere I sit, retreated into self.\nThe book of me sitting on a shelf.\n\nOriginal Conversation https://youtu.be/_WqdrvNb8lI\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/remembering-voth\nTo Join the Bridges of
