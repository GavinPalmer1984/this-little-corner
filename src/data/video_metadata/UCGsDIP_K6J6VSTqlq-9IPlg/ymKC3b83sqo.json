 "description": "I must confess I get snarky in this video so I'll ask some forgiveness and give this warning. I really like a lot of Bret's work. I enjoy podcasts and videos where he's talking about theories of evolutionary sources of behavior. I find these ideas fascinating and I actually agree with a number of the ideas he expresses in this conversation with Alistair McGrath. I'm also a fan of McGrath's work and I've read a number of his books. What triggers me about Bret on Religion is how Bret can't seem to own the fideistic nature of his value presuppositions nor the religious nature of his prescriptions. For a guy who couldn't tolerate Hebrew school as a youth he's prescribing a pretty freedom-less approach to world saving for the future. To err is human as is to be unwittingly inconsistent so I certainly offer him forgiveness for those as I wish them for myself. \n\nUnbelievable McGrath and Weinstein https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nCS Lewis' Miracles https://amzn.to/2ZYYeXH\nCS Lewis Abolition of Man https://amzn.to/2ZYYeXH\nAlister McGrath CS Lewis Biography https://amzn.to/2ZYDajg\nAlister McGrath Heresy https://amzn.to/2ZYMFil\nThe Kingdom of Matthias (recommended by Bret) https://amzn.to/32MB2ZT\n\n Click here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
