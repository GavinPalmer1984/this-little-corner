I recall sitting in Shul thinking ~\"I'm enamored with modern images and narratives of outer space - by comparison, the ancient Genesis creation account seems outdated and made up - So this whole 'G-D' and 'religion' thing is probably all like that.\" Tom Holland hit a similar hurdle with Dinosaurs. I now wonder how often this lack of discernment spiritually and intellectually absconds children from pews - and if religious institutions may find ways to recognize, honor, and address these objections of their most precocious children? Short of handing out copies of Mattheiu Pageau's book to 9 year olds, how do you sell faith to science-oriented kids?\n\nI've been thinking more about our access to God since my question to you last week which I was glad to see you expand upon elsewhere (Reminder to the viewers here to watch the finished sermons on the Living Stones channel too!!!)\nI find often when talking with non-Christians, be they professing members of another faith or not, that they often don't understand the difference between the person of God the Father and the notion of the Godhead entire.\nIt is in fact such confusion that led me into modalism as an early teen before finding myself pulled into the orthodoxy of the Reformed Tradition.\nIs it perhaps because we see the face of the Father in the Son, the will of the Father in the Word, the nature of the Father in Sophia and the presence of the Father in the Spirit that we are inevitably left \"seeing\" the entire Trinity when we look to the Father and so are kept from seeing the Father as a personage?\n\nHope my reference to Sophia doesn't freak you out as much as it does my other Reformed contacts. Fear not, I don't use references to the Divine Wisdom to push for a modernist feminist understanding of theology, rather it's a lens by which I understand the relationship between the Father and Son in the cosmic hierarchy, in line with the headship model put forth by the Apostle Paul.\n\nRealise this is a long one but you're the only guy who I think could have as much fun with this riddle as I do.\n\nHey Paul! Does the Parable of the Tares (enemy sows weeds with the wheat) have anything to say to the recent political unrest (BLM and/or Capitol riots)?\n\nIs Jesus instructing us to discern when the cure might be worse than the disease in practical matters? i.e. Should we tolerate some evil in our institutions because identifying its true cause becomes too difficult or uprooting it does more harm than good? Or, should this parable be confined to eschatological readings?
