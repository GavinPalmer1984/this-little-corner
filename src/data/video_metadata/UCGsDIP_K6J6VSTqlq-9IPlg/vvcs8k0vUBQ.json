We should observe ourselves through this change and learn about the process. \n\nRebel Wisdom Coronavirus Sense-Making https://youtu.be/3--5kcQIkyQ\nWikipedia Sensemaking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking\nGK Chesterton Orthodoxy https://amzn.to/2QtAbtg\nHomoDeus https://amzn.to/2Ulrpic\nDouthat Decadent Society https://amzn.to/2xc5EJS\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/3a6L9Ng\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
