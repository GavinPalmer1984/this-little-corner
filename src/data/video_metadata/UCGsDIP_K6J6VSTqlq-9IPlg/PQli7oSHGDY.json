 "description": "JP and I first spoke a few months ago. He had some challenges to John Vervaeke's physicalism. John picked up the challenge and JP started his own YouTube channel. \n\nI've been skeptical about both sides so I got to ask JP to explain his panpsychism in terms I could understand and to see if I needed to feel guilty about all the little computer generated men I've slaughtered for decades. \nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
