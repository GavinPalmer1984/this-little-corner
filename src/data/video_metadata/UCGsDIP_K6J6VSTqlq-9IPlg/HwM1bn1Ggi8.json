Thiel was recently with Eric Metaxas at Socrates in the City and talked about Progress. The video is well worth watching. This is not an indepth treatment of that video but rather a revisiting of the subject of how we know the good and therefore how we might imagine we can know what progress is. \n\nPeter Thiel Eric Metaxas Zero to One https://youtu.be/SO_00POR-Po\nZero to One https://amzn.to/3eSir5x\nSevilla King Quality Experience https://youtu.be/4XEPiYw_N0E\nWeinstein and Schmachtenberger Search for Fullness https://youtu.be/4bzwv7mzzCc\nEric and Bret Weinstein and the End of History https://youtu.be/xkuw8dDAThA\nEric Weinstein Playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoN1YN2VX2g&list=PLYSXopxC8Z9uHSPwJfvP_jro-3yeBrw3J\nGK Chesterton Heretics https://amzn.to/2yIKjZ4\nJordan Peterson Sam Harris A-Priori Structure https://youtu.be/LwWKjdLjtIA\nJordan Peterson Maps of Meaning 2017 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Xc2_FtpHI&list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h\nRebel Wisdom Conspiracy Pandemic Vervaeke https://youtu.be/1P8pLXYT44U\nDouthat the Decadent Society https://amzn.to/3cBPg4z\nLife, Death and Undeath American Comics https://youtu.be/l6ocLYr6hk4\nPostmodernism is Dead Edward Docx http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/postmodernism-is-dead-va-exhibition-age-of-authenticism\nRod Dreher Pilgrims vs Tourists https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/pilgrims-vs-tourists-zygmunt-bauman/\nChesterton Everlasting Man https://amzn.to/2VvF2xb\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
