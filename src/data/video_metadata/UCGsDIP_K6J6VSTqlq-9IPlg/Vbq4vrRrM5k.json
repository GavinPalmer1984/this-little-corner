 "description": "Michael asked that I lead off with this disclaimer: Disclaimer: I apologize for the frequent pauses and \"umm\"s and \"likes\". I wasn't even conscious of it because I'm really not used to speaking in this format and I'm sorry if my speaking annoyed you. Paul was very nice about it so you should too!\n\nWhen I told my wife she said I should have a far stronger disclaimer on all my videos of all the things I get wrong. :) \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
