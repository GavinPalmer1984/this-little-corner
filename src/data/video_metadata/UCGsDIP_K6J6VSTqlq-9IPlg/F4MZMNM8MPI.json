David and I seem to agree that a dream was last that was first felt with the rise of Jordan Peterson that the IDW is still sort of floundering around. David, better than most, seems to be able to articulate that moment and get at some of what we need. \n\nDavid Fuller on Andrea Lewis' channel https://youtu.be/rgFpp8WzQCg\nRebel Wisdom https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQ6Gptuq-sLflbJ4YY3Umw\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
