JBP with Andrew Klavan", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ3Mvcq4eAc", "date": "2021-06-10", "description": "As promised to my followup from the @Rebel Wisdom commentary I want to listen to @Andrew Klavan and his recent chat with @Jordan B Peterson . \n\nThere is definitely an issue of ideological hazard with Peterson as Jonathan Rowson and David Fuller noticed. Peterson lays out the reasons but his reluctance to live a religious (s) life places him in this hazard. \n\nKlaven and he then go onto the definition of faith. It's hard not to see Peterson as having faith in God but why still the reluctant posture with respect to the church? \n\nAndrew Klavan and Jordan Peterson recent https://youtu.be/p0s7NKwbNSY\nOlder Klavan interview: https://youtu.be/ZF_8jjbFdew\nCommentary on David Fuller and Jonathan Rowson's talk https://youtu.be/J9_tXN88sJk\nAndrew Klavan Great Good Thing https://amzn.to/3w5XbkO\n\nDiscord link.
