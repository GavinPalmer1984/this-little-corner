 "description": "We just launched a new Jordan Peterson Meetup in Chicago! If you have friends in Chicago invite them. We chatted with Sam and Hank from Chicago and Joey who grew up in Chicago and launched the discord server about why we think these meetups are so valuable and why we're continuing to try to start new ones. Why do we think churches should encourage and support these meetups? What value do they offer churches? What value can churches offer these meetups? We also talked about whether or not we should continue to use Jordan's name on them. \n\nChicago Land Jordan Peterson Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Chicagoland-Bridges-of-Meaning-Meetup\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
