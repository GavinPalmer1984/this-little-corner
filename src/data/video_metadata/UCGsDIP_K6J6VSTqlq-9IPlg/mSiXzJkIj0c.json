 "description": "Mary \"the smart lady from the comments section\" is back and wanted to piggy back on Cassidy's conversation about cults. She's bringing a lot of books with her. \nPrevious conversation with Mary https://youtu.be/WdlMtQSKszc\nWith Cassidy on Cults and Tongues https://youtu.be/gsW1hUDDKlg\n\nCult and occult\nCult from agriculture, cultivation\nOrigin of religious devotion had to do with agriculture\nDisambiguation\nGood cult, neutral cult and bad cult\nSects\nModern phenomenon started around the 1960s\nKidnapping, deprogramming, snapped back to reality\nPhase 3, stepping back and studying it\n\n3 definitions of cults\n\n1. The popular definition: Cults were small groups, they dressed weird, they lived in isolation fanatically devoted to the teachings of one leader. Cults attracted stupid, weakminded people. \n\nThat definition is inaccurate. \nIf you have it in your mind that the people who get into cults are stupid and weak minded, that leaves you vulnerable to being recruited. \n\n2. A theological definition of a cult. Dr. Walter Martin. Kingdom of the Cults. Watchmen fellowship. \n\nAdd, substract, multiply and divide. \nAdds to the Bible\nSubtracts from the deity of Christ or the Trinity\nMultiplies what you need to do for salvation\nDivides the person from their family and friends\n\n3. More academic standpoint. Based more on the actions that the belief structure, Deed not creed. \n\nSee if you can locate some models. Communism. Robert J. Lifton https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Jay-Lifton/e/B000APASEI\nModel of the abused woman. The person who identifies with the abuser\nInternational Cultic Studies association\n\nInteract with former cult members. \nInterviewed people\nMary, as a former JW sat with 70 people from other cults. \n\nHow similar all of the experiences are. \nCults actively recruit people. And they don\u2019t actively recruit stupid or weak minded people\nDeception in recruiting\nHijacked lives. \nTwisted Scriptures: by CHRNALOGAR. https://www.amazon.com/Twisted-Scriptures-Breaking-Churches-Abuse-ebook/dp/B000SEVTL2\nTaking an illegitimate amount of authority over the life of a person\nA cult cannot manage a civilization\nThey restrict the domains in which people can operate\n\nReleasing the bonds by Hassan https://www.amazon.com/Releasing-Bonds-Empowering-People-Themselves/dp/0967068800\nCult Proofing your kids: dr. Martin. Wellspring retreat and resource center. https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Proofing-Your-Kids-Martin/dp/0310537614\nMargert Thaler Singer: cults in our midst https://www.amazon.com/Cults-Our-Midst-Continuing-Against/dp/0787967416\nDifference between a cult and the US Marines\nCaptive hearts, captive minds. https://www.amazon.com/Captive-Hearts-Minds-Recovery-Relationships/dp/0897931440\nSurvivors of cults \nRecovery from Cults\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
