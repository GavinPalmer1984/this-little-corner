But to intentionally say, 'We don't look multi-ethnic enough, and the multiethnic church is Biblical and right, and we are lacking, so we need to intentionally do things to change that,' feels off to me in some way.  I think I have a concern that making multiethicity A focus of the church could shift into becoming THE focus of the church.  And the potential prospect of making it the top of the hierarchy troubles me.\nAll that said, my actual question is, in your view what was/is the Christian impetus for intentionally making your local church a multiethnic one like the one your dad started and you grew up in, and is there anything non-Christian about a church that isn't intentionally pushing itself to be more ethnically diverse?\n\n16:30 Kinnism, THe CRC, Critical Race Theory\n\n23:09 Spartan Theology, talking with an atheist. Jesus and Paul's connection to Essenes. \n\n36:21 Calvinism: Predictability \n\n41:00 I wonder what PVK thinks of \"natural evangelism?\" Or any of the various methods of evangelism being widely encouraged today? Methods he thinks are done well and others he's concerned to see within the church.\n\n56:00 . So, I've been listening to Jonathan Pageau about, angels, demons and principalities and I have difficult time understanding what they are and able to articulate to others about it. So, what are angels, demons and principalities, and is there a different explanation from Orthodox Christian and the Protestant?? Thank you for your time\n\n1:09:00 Job. Pre-covid Anything done for my church. \n\n1:18:00 The internet tends to create monopolies, particularly for information-based products. Do you worry about the future of moving sermons online, and the fact that this would create a competitive winner-take-all environment that would mostly replace local churches and pastors for mega-churches that don't have physical constraints, and would optimize for entertainment/platform value instead?\n\n1:23:00  What is your view of salvation when considering what role our human effort may play in it or not? Specifically in regard to Ephesians 2:8 \u201cFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u201d? Though we recognize we can do nothing except by grace, do you believe that the \u201cthrough faith\u201d part involves some sort of human cooperation with God in the sense that \u201cfaithfulness\u201d might be bound up with what \u201cfaith\u201d is? Or is salvation not dependent on our cooperation in any way? Or perhaps there is even another way you understand faith than this? Is there perhaps a paradox that can\u2019t be fully understood here?\n\n1:35:00   I have always had a problem with the overwhelming support of the death penalty by the Christian community.  Am I mistaken  that John 8 covers the way god views this after the new covenant? As  well in many more red letter verses.\n\n1:42:00 Training your faith muscles. \n\n1:46:00  How does that \"do in secret\" jive with the spreading of the gospel?\n\nClick here to meetup with other
