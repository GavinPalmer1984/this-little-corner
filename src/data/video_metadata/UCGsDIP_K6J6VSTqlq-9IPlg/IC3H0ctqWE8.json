 "description": "This is kind of Commentary on Bib Series 4e. I'm wrestling with 2 questions: how is JBP changing people's opinions about the Bible and might he make a significant impact on the history of Biblical interpretation. \n\nBiblical interpretation is a big deal and Peterson looks like he's working an earlier model of symbolism and allegory but I think he's really post-Grammatical/historical for a post-Christian, Jungian method. \n\nI start with Bib series 4 where he gets into the walled garden and connects it with chaos/order. That's a very basic move in terms of concordism. Should we dismiss it? We should look at the foundations of Biblical interpretation and ask some questions.",
