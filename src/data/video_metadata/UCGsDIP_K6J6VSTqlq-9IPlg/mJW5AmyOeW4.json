According to Christian calendar, Romanians from Banat, Transilvania, Bucovina and Maramure? countries celebrate Easter of Blajini on first Monday after St. Thomas Sunday. Easter of Blajini is called also Easter of Deaths or Mighty Easter. Romanians generally perceived the earth as a disc, and they imagined what existed on the other side. This other earth is imagined as a mirror image of our own, and as a home to creatures called Blajini [bla'?in?] (\"gentle/kind-hearted ones\"), sometimes given the name Rohmani ['roh.man?] in Bucovina. They are described as anthropomorphic and short, sometimes having the head of a rat. They are either described as malicious or as having great respect for God and leading a sinless life. They are considered to fast the year through, and thus doing humans a great service.\nSecret world, legends, Blajini are in there\nGeorge MacDonald   Princess and Curdie, \nCS Lewis\u2019 Space Trilogy\nPerelandra, Genesis and Mark at the same time\nHeraclitus and Democritus\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
