Powerful, you get the tingles\nHe moved the group. \nMore of an avenue to hang out, left ideas hanging in his head\nEveryone was religious, it wasn't easy to speak out\nPropositional conversations. Didn't get to the heart of it. The frames were separate\n\nThere wasn't an appreciation for the frame with his friends\nJesus sacrificing himself didn't seem like a sacrifice if he went back to heaven\nIt was a place holder\nIn a household there is an animosity to religious thinking\nThey felt they had to defend themselves against the position to move forward\nThe groups consolidated on the defenses, Ideological handshakes\nWhen you're willing to step back, your kind of poking people in their axioms\n\nFound JBP, suspender video, Rogan, rabbit hole, \n\nDidn't have a concept of Inspiration for his movement forward\nGot hit with depression. Depression is pervasive in the family\n\nHe stopped caring, it was gone. Got put on an SSRI\n\nShift when he took mushrooms. It wasn't the mystical experience that shifted, An opening of being able to conceptualize a positive way of looking at the world. Existence itself became enough\n\nIt energized him. Strawberry Swing, Frank Ocean. \n\nYou have to make sense of that powerful experience. Your ego tries to take it over. \"this was mine\" \n\nSettled into this idea of being content. I can move forward. \n\nAnd then JBP came into the frame. \n\nThere's more to being. You can have more if you want it. \n\nIt highjacked a lot of the processes. \n\nThe concepts were deeper and fuller. \n\nLiving in a fractured dream. There's splits. \n\nAbandoning The comforts of nihilism. The contentedness is a fa\u00e7ade\n\n\"I don't care\" is a powerful tool to put everything aside. \n\nPageau to RR \"Where are you standing?\" \n\nYou're detached, but you're hyper focused on something\n\nIt allows for a sort of haze. You're so focused on something so you're ignoring everything else\n\nIts actually one of the beauties of being younger is because you're sitting in so much potential you can focus on one thing and ignore everything else. But for living your day to day life it's an abuse of the fact that you can be in so much potential. The potential is going to collapse as you're moving forward. \n\nJBP: ideas have people\u2026 As you move forward you're building something and other things are collapsing. \n\nIt's real suffering to care\n\nIf I were to die tomorrow. My parents wouldn't care if I didn't have a house, it's the quality of love that we share with each other. \n\nPart of me wants to write off the house as an aside. It's not enough of the picture. \n\nPeterson's Cock-a-doodle-do\n\nGoal: Want an American Akida\n\nGirlfriend, wife kids, house, stable job\n\nBuild a relationship with God, walk with God, I want to feel as if I'm acting in a more integrated way that best besets my life and my interactions with the transcendent\n\nHard to bring it back in. \n\nNeed to start looking at it more like that. \n\nAwe and terror, the opening and the closing\n\nIntense psychedelic experiences, the two are walking hand in hand, the awe and the terror\n\nThe Body Keeps the Score\n\nEMDR\n\nHow Emotions are Made: Feldmen-Barrett\n\nFrame of a classical view and tries to add more nuance to it. Directly related to the issue with words\n\nTried to find a fingerprint for emotions\n\nVisual interpretation, The concepts bleed together, the inferences overlap\n\nDo we have an angry \"circuitry\" \n\nWE build the inferences from concepts. \n\n\"Angry\" is not a real thing, it's a concept\n\nDifferent cultures will have different emotions, IT's inferences all the way down\n\nIt's the relevance realization, it's not the concept itself, where are these concepts coming from. There's an issue there. \n\nPay attention to what you're doing and what concepts, your arguments are presuppositions. \n\nThey're not arguing about the thing, they're arguing about the value of the presuppositions and how they play in you rlife. \n\nYou have inferences all the way down. How those inferences come together. \n\nYou stare into a vacuum of inferences. You see the interaction without the words.
