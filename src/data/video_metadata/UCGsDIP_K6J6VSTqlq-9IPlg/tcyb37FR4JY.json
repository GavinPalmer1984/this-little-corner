 "description": "Shane comes in for a convo conversation. He has such an interesting story but he doesn't want the story to take the hour. He's got questions so here we go. \n\nAirforce brat\nFather was an outlier\nColorado springs, met shane's mom\nSchool bus and some goats, from San Antonia to Montana, 100 acres on top of a mountain\nEnough education to teach. Not a good mix. Logging community\nEureka Montana, population 300\n7th day Adventist church, father trained for leadership in it, moving around\nFemale prophet debunked, it wrecked his faith\nLeft the faith, got involved in all sorts of things\nMoved to Missoula, \nMom maintained her faith because of all of that\nExperience of worshipping with a black church is so much different from a Montana church\nHe has to be loving, he has to be able to do miracles\nBy 12 had been in the meaning crisis without being a victim of evil\nDrugs, adult relationships early, friends of older siblings \nGot girlfriend pregnant as a sophomore in High school, \nConvince her to marry him\nUniversity of Montana\nLegally divorced lost the financial aid\nVervaeke\nJordan Peterson\nDon't have to betray a deep value to entertain an idea that might be contradictory\nCompound interest applies in ways of knowing\nIt's having a dad who's been able to have a certain kind of relationship with other people\nBring the 4-P of knowing into church\nDr. Jim\nHow can we get people to trust each other first\u2026\nTeach people to trust and be trust-worthy\nWe need an economy of trust. Churches are counterfeiting the economy of trust\nThey are obligating people to give credit to people who are not credit worthy\nEric Weinstein super-position. \n\n 1. Share thoughts on how might people try to structure a trusting community\n 2. When I think about my responsibility to God, what do I think that is as it relates to building a community of trust\n 3. What do I think is possible within my lifetime in the age of decay\n\nUnconditional positive regard for the human but call out and respectfully say BS\n\nThat's how you trust somebody because you see them exercise their trust in God\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
