When do Answers become Idolatrous?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNwPDsqjw8w", "date": "2019-06-13", "description": "Eric ponders what conversion is. He's converted so many times he's becoming a student of conversion. We work on his conversionism. \n\nNotes on the talk \nMoving to Miami, finished PhD and trying to land a job\nMoving back home with family where the rent is free\nRepeat guest\nConversion, \nHow did he convert\nWhy did he convert\nDifference between converting and being converted\nConversions through admiration, getting people\u2019s elephants to turn around through admiration\nConversion through new Atheists, because he admired these people\nConversion through Jordan Peterson, through admiration. Became Petersonian, act as if God exists\nHow he converted, read the gospels and admired Jesus. He moved Eric\u2019s elephant, so he became a Christian. The process of converting. \nConvert through Admiration. Maya Angelou, people will forget what you said but remember how you made them feel\nWhy he converted. Math was his rock. Made him a man with a chest\nTrying to install the software of scientific materialism to solve the framing problem deflated his chest\nMathematics kept him with a chest\nDidn\u2019t want to be a pagan, be subject to the whims and mercies of gods he didn\u2019t know\nHe wasn\u2019t sufficient. Wanted to be a slave to a master of his own choosing\nYou need a transcendent value\nAlso related to Pascal\u2019s wager. He had nothing to lose\nTime to tell people what he meant by why he converted. \nReligion provides a solution to the framing problem. \nUse the myths, events that happen all the time in some eternal nature\nThe moral of the myth was the answer to that problem. \nThought of converting in terms of installing software, these safety nets\nYou can\u2019t unlearn what you know\nUninstalling the bugs from his atheist software. We live in a story-verse. \nTolstoy\u2019s confession, being in the same place as he was\nNo one has the answer, and that\u2019s the answer\nAnswers can be idols\nWhere there is life there is faith. You can\u2019t have life without faith.\nTolstoy found admiration\nPart of his conversion was uninstalling his bugs\nYou have to listen. Idols get in the way\nFinding elephants to follow. Converting\nTim Keller, conditions necessary for conversion. You have to see people you admire for you to convert\nYou have to have background knowledge and be able to answer people\u2019s questions\nSomewhat properly converted. \nTook up prayer, pray the \u201cOur Father\u201d \nTried various ways of prayer\nIf you just tell the truth that\u2019s an adventure of a lifetime\nWhat does it mean to \u201caccept the Lord Savior\u201d tell the truth or at least don\u2019t lie\nHad to learn enough. Had to know enough.\nUnderstood Christianity symbolically very quickly. You can\u2019t make this up. \nWe have Christianity because a bunch of people claim to have scene him and were willing to die for it. \nTom Holland, NT Wright discussion on Unbelievable\nPeople were smart in the past\nTook the Apostle Paul 14 years\nConsider himself fully converted, fully embedded, or at least his reflexes have changes.\nWhat would Jesus do\nJesus suffered far greater shame and humiliation than some photoshops\nYou can\u2019t ridicule Jesus\nSilence, the Novel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_(novel)\nJoy as part of the Christian life\nhttp://www.wittenburgdoor.com/ \nLaughter and crying\n\u201cAct as if\u201d  is synonymous with pretend which gives us pause\nImpostor syndrome\nI have to get to a church so I don\u2019t feel like an impostor\nAll of this is a product of admiration\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes
