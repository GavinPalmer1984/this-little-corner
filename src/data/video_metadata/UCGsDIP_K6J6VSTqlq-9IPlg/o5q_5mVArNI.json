To be a free and independent person, not dependent on someone else. \n\nWhat would the church say to David (Dave Rubin's partner)? \n\nYour desire to be a father is wonderful. It noble, is good. It is the calling of a man. It comes out of a good place in  you. To imitate God. How ought you to go about that. \n\nA lot of it has to do with what we're worshiping\n\nRoman Catholic church has a big appreciation for male sexual energy as a great potent thing. The basic thing that runs a civilization is male, sexual energy. \n\nYou have this great energy and we want to give you mastery of that energy to channel that for the building of civilization. The church has all sorts of spiritual tools, psychological tools, etc. to channel that energy. \n\nVoth : the man is like the trolley car, the woman is the track that directs that energy. \n\nSarah wants Abraham's sexual energy to be involved. \n\nSexual energy sublimated to greater things. \n\nPope John Paul: the Church does not have the authority to ordain women\n\nIf the Virgin Mary is not a priest then we don't have the authority\n\nSub-mission\n\nMan needed the support of women that mankind may not fall\n\nNot enough coming to grips with the pervasive injustices of the society\n\nCan distributism answer game b questions\n\nThe Chester-Belloc\n\nThe Servile State\n\nHow did the church reformulate, an economy of wide ownership. How did that change? \n\nProductive property widely distributed\n\nBret Weinstein Subsidiarity\n\nOwn or be-owned\n\nYou can only give charity to the un-deserving. \n\nThe beggar is the protagonist of history. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
