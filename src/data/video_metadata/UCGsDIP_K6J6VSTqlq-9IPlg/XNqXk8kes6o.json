 "description": "Skeptics are a feature of human community, not a bug. Skeptics are a part of the process of finding truth. If you have a community of knowledge you will have skeptics. In this time some knowledge of that the Bible calls \"the Day of the LORD\" is helpful. It always comes, we are seldom ready for it. It comes to all of us, alone or together. \n\nLinks:\nOSJ Controlling the Virus Narrative https://www.wsj.com/articles/controlling-the-virus-narrative-11584899715 (paywall)\nEvidence and Hysteria https://www.zerohedge.com/health/covid-19-evidence-over-hysteria\nTweet on state conspiracy https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1242006583535489024\nDoctors selling cigarettes https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement\nAlan Jacobs Year of our Lord 1943 https://amzn.to/2QE706I\nMarsden: Twilight of the American Enlightenment https://amzn.to/3bmMcZz\nMy chat with Tom Holland https://youtu.be/_JADIcgUvw4\n4 states of pandemic sense making https://youtu.be/vvcs8k0vUBQ\nDouthat Decadent Society https://amzn.to/2wxfpSO\nThe Bible Project Joel https://youtu.be/zQLazbgz90c\nPandemic and the Judgment of God https://youtu.be/_NMaLw0J3EQ\nHarari https://amzn.to/2WFQQNZ\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
