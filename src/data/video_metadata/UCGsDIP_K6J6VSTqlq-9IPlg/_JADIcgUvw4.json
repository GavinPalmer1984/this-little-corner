 "description": "Tom Holland demonstrates that history writes the best literature. Unfortunately many historians don't write for a popular audience. Tom began by wanting to write fiction but fell in love with history and hasn't turned back. Along the way he was grabbed by the beauty of Christianity and has been trying to figure out how it changed the world and is changing himself. He graciously gave me a couple of hours for a conversation. \n\nDelingpod Interview https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nDominion https://amzn.to/39DFa1X\nIn the Shadow of the Sword https://amzn.to/2wK0ggC\nPersian Fire https://amzn.to/3344dZK\nThe Religion of Israel https://amzn.to/3341fEC\nInspiring Philosophy: Evolutionary vs Revolutionary Monotheism https://youtu.be/za260DIsgzQ\nBlood and Thunder https://amzn.to/2TUtfGl\n\nNotes\nJesus as Greatest short story writer of all time\n\nPersian Fire\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really trust them\u201d\n\nBlood and Thunder\n\nThe inherently mythic\n\nOne god, one empire, emperors auditioning gods\n\nGod has auditioned himself twice to covenants\n\nMuslim God does not bind himself to covenants\n\nThe figure of the calif and the figure of the \n\nThe separation of law from direct \n\nDoes that roman posture relate to the islamic posture? \n\nThe divine and the human is interfused\n\nThat one God has given a framework of law that has given his presence to be everywhere\n\nPay taxes to the romans?
