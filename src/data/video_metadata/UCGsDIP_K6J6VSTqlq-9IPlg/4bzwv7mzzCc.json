 "description": "Eric Weinstein's Portal podcast arrives at a fascinating conclusion. They realize that all the goods of status, pleasure and enjoyment only go so far. Could they point to something beyond this world? \n\nGk Chesterton's \"Heretics\" made this point over 100 years ago. We know the good only because we know evil and we struggle to know the good as such. You cannot have progress unless you have a vision of the good. \n\nPortal 27 https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kast-media-2/the-portal-2/e/68383234\n\nGK Chesterton Heretics https://amzn.to/3aNvmTG\n\nOneida https://amzn.to/2wpitAs\n\nIs Marriage Over? https://aeon.co/essays/marriage-is-dead-long-live-marriage-how-will-we-couple-up\n\nKeep Christianity Weird https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/keep-christianity-weird-sunday-st-mary-of-egypt/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
