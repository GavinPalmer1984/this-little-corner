YouTube Change of Policy about non-Monetized Channels", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIMQogCKJtE", "date": "2020-11-21", "description": "You might have noticed a new thing on my channel. Ads for videos. YouTube changed their service policy to be able to include ads on videos even on non-monetized channels as mine has been so I figured I might as well turn the ads on. \n\nOne way to not see ads is to use Youtube Premium where you don't see ads. I've done this for years. \n\nI'll run it this way for a while and see how it goes. Please let me know what you think in the comments section. Sorry. \n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573937/youtube-ads-creators-partner-program-revenue-terms-of-service-update", "duration": 396, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "hi this is paul some of
