 "description": "We kicked off the meetup tour with our meetup in Tucson AZ. We met at the Village church. Rod Hugen who pastors there has been on the channel. We had 35 people show up including a number of curious members of the church. We also had a group from a Philosophy meetup group as well as some of the folks some of you will recognize from the channel. We did our usual introductions and discussions for the first two hours, took a picture and people were still talking late into the night. Poor Job was pretty jetlagged so we left before midnight. \n\nAll of the editing for this video was graciously done by Job. No I haven't started video editing my videos... \n\nMarch 2  Tucson AZ:  https://www.meetup.com/Tucson-ConverZations/events/268937092/ \nMarch 4  Bellflower CA:   https://www.meetup.com/Jordan-Peterson-Appreciation-Society/events/268965849/\nMarch 5  Chino CA:https://www.meetup.com/Jordan-Peterson-Inland-Empire-Meetup/events/268564977/\nMarch 14 Fresno CA: https://www.meetup.com/Fresno-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/events/267837868/   \nMarch 15 Sacramento CA: https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/events/267806924/\nMarch 16 Salem OR: https://www.meetup.com/Salem-Jordan-B-Peterson-Meetup-Group/events/269089771/\nMarch 17 Seattle WA https://www.meetup.com/Icon-Church-Cultural-Meetups/events/269046699/\nMarch 18 Vancouver Burnaby BC: https://www.meetup.com/Burnaby-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/events/268839207/ \nMarch 19 Portland OR: CANCELLED: the  Evening with PVK, Peter Boghossian and Benjamin Boyce.
