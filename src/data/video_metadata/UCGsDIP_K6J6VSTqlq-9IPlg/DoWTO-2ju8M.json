Someone told me he should reach out and talk to me. He wanted to introduce me to Rene Girard so he did. He has interviews with Jordan Peterson and David Bentley Hart on his channel too. Here's our talk. \n\nwww.aneighborschoice.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DavidGornoski/\n\nNotes from our talk\nBill Kaufmann author American is a rootless culture\nChurch of God Anderson\nPolitical commentary\nWFLA in Orlando 93.1 540 AM Iheart media radio station\nNeighbor\u2019s choice God desires mercy not sacrifice\nProgram for people who are tired of group think, scapegoat ping pong\nSlaying sacred cows\nJesus is the true atheist of our time\nThe gods of our time are government, ideology, politics for our salvation\nImitate the person of Jesus in a tangible way\n12 Rules for Life, did an interview with Jordan Peterson\nJordan Peterson is a gateway drug to studying the scriptures\nFollower of Ron Paul\nHumans need role models to get them animated\nDavid Bentley Hart\u2019s politics\nRene Girard\nThe memetic theory\nA way of unifying the social sciences into a unified perspective\nPattern by studying the great works of western literature\nSlaying the father every time we come to a text. The text has no father.\nAll the great texts have similar patterns. \nHow they show human conflict arising. He saw meaning throughout of it.\nA triangular nature of desire. \nOur objects of desire are because our neighbors have them\nWe desire our neighbor\u2019s being. \nHuman beings are wired to imitate at a level greater than any other species\nChimpanzees will imitate on a basic level. The children would go through the ritual to get the treat. \nImitation source of our beauty and evil\nImitate when it comes to rivalry and envy and jealousy\nGossip spreads the contagion. \nHumans were often in conflict over the same person. \nAt some point the object disappears and they become obsessed with one-upping their neighbor\nYou can see it with childhood skirmishes. \nLoony tunes demonstrates Girard\nThe Avengers, Superhero stories and movies are a vestige of ancient mythologies+\nThere is the one and the many\nWhen you have a community caught up in rivalry\nTake it out on a third party\nPlace the blame on another\nWe can unify through blame\nPastors are professional scapegoats\nScapegoats have a paradoxical insider and outsider status\nIf they\u2019re totally different you can\u2019t blame them\nChannel some of the localness into the sacrifice\nEating the food of the local community in order to sacrifice them. \nMock king sacrifice and then sacrificed\nThink about the origins of this. There needs to be a way of effectively channeling that imitation in a safe way when it\u2019s necessary. \nMark of Lamech\nYou have to find a way to resolve that. An arbitrary difference to make it stand out\nWe don\u2019t want imitation until we lose our sense of self, why we hate the imitation game\nTrump\nMaintenance of a sense of order again. \nWhen a community kills together and there is catharsis, the power of mementic group think\nThe founding murder of human anthropology\nSatan was a murderer from the beginning. How can the accuser cast out the accuser.\nWe divinize our victims\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
