 "description": "A Quality Existence is a YouTube channel that explores many of the same ideas this channel does from the perspective of a Metaphysic of Quality. Sevilla uses the work of Robert Pirsig who wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance to facilitate this exploration. She caught my attention a while ago when she was commenting on Jordan Peterson and CS Lewis. Recently she did a couple of videos about the differences between the work of Jonathan Vervaeke and Jonathan Pageau. \n\nHer Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vg0HkKKlgsWk-3HfV-vnw\n\nNotes\nZen and the art of motorcycle maintenance\nNoetic dimension victor Frankl\nWith Pirsig it felt like he was touching bottom\nMetaphysics of Quality\nTurn it into something in therapy\nSpiritual intervention\nJordan Peterson\nPeople don\u2019t connect with organized religion\nArt school\nAlan Watts\nRichard Rohr\nCS Lewis\nScrewtape Letters\nMiracles\nMaps of Meaning\nQuality drives the universe, what is better is what is more free\nWe\u2019re limited beings, we\u2019re expanding towards less and less limitation\nThings grow in complexity\nLevels of Quality, static levels of quality\nThese upper levels are subjective\nThe subjective is just as real as the objective\nThat way of seeing the world is so productive\nThe analytical knife\nThe more experiments you produce the more objects you produce\nYou just keep cutting\nYou can\u2019t just see you and things in the world\nLila, the second book, turns it into an actual philosophy\nSeeing that underlying metaphysics, God can be in there\nThe drive is to the better, the good, limitless\nThe upward trajectory is a moral one\nThe ghost of reason\nThe medieval worldview the symbols are as alive and real as the material in the world, more real\nNot until we discover rationality that we have a relationship\nIt\u2019s meaning, not material\nVervaeke\nThe problem began with Aristotle\nQuality is a thing that infiltrates\nAlways towards what\u2019s better\nYou sense quality\nThe flow state\nGumption\nApplied metaphysics, Vervaeke\nThe morality is the hardest part\nThe way we are by frank putnam\nDynamical systems\nThere\u2019s an inherent movement in nature\nOur moods and our states transition with the undercurrent\nEvidence to see ourselves as multiple\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\n\n\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://beta.lbry.tv/@paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
