 "description": "When I listened to Dave Rubin on Unbelievable I heard a redux of Cold War Civil Religion. What amazed me was that Dave Rubin should have been a trophy of New Atheism but instead exactly the opposite happened. Why? \n\nRecently Slate Star Codex had a piece \"New Atheism: The Godlessness that Failed\" which laid out how New Atheism is being consumed by the Church of Social Justice. Dave Rubin perfectly illustrates that as well as how Jordan Peterson marks the end of New Atheism's power and the IDW in many ways its refugees. \n\nDave Rubin and John Lennox on Unbelievable Pt 1 https://youtu.be/m0Ov4HBperc Pt. 2 https://youtu.be/Lzm29d2zo_s\nRobert Bellah  http://www.robertbellah.com/index.html \r\nCivil Religion in America http://www.robertbellah.com/articles_5.htm\r\nHabits of the Heart https://amzn.to/2rdhLna\nBlack Earth https://amzn.to/35WzVrY\nHomo Deus https://amzn.to/2OLZ17b\nHomo Sapien https://amzn.to/2LmkPUG\nChristian Smith Soul Searching https://amzn.to/2r29z9n\nSSC New Atheism The Godlessness that Failed https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/30/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed/\nPVK with James Lindsay https://youtu.be/sZ520OLvDZs\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2rUfP2S\nDavid Brooks the Road to Character https://amzn.to/2Pc5Pdt\nEisenhower Sin and Moderation https://paulvanderklay.me/2015/04/29/the-road-to-character-chapter-3-the-eisenhowers-plus-sin-and-moderation/\nRod Dreher Leftists attack 1619 Project https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/attack-on-1619-project-socialists/\nPeter Boghossian in Aquila Report https://www.theaquilareport.com/welcome-to-culture-war-2-0-the-great-realignment/\nPeter Boghossian James Lindsay the Trojan Horse https://youtu.be/YDFL3xwEEG8\nJordan Peterson Biblical Series https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w\nMark Noll Biologos Bible as Church on Frontier https://biologos.org/files/modules/noll_scholarly_essay.pdf\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
