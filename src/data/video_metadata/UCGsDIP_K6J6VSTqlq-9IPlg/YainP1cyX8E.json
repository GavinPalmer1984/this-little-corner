Coleman Hughes with John McWhorter notes Dr. King's reliance on religion. Bret Weinstein according to Alister McGrath thinks we almost need a new religion. Auguste Comte tried exactly this but if we compare it to what Joseph Smith did it was a failure. Why? \n\nHow then must we define religion? How did Paul Tillich define it? We go back to Jordan Peterson at Lafayette College and questions about religion. It's inevitable. We'll look at why CS Lewis picked Christianity. Charles Taylor's \"fullness\". Byrne Power's cheap \"fun\" in America and finally what I think of as a Pragmatic Darwinian Pascal's Wager. \n\nColeman Hughes and John McWhorter https://youtu.be/UPiNiTwf5bM\nBret Weinstein and Alister McGrath https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nAuguste Comte School of Life Sociology https://youtu.be/OhVamhT4Q3s\nAuguste Comte Tom Richey https://youtu.be/OhVamhT4Q3s\nSam Harris JBP Vancouver 1 https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\nJohn Vervaeke Awakening from the Meaning Crisis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_ewcOlY&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\nPaul Tillich Ultimate Concern https://youtu.be/M_HcFLa0b1Q\nJordan Peterson on Religion at Lafayette College https://youtu.be/V32WHDuy-Do\nCS Lewis in Sheldon VanAuken a Severe Mercy https://amzn.to/2RxEnZX\nTim Keller Making Sense of God https://amzn.to/30XTij0\nByrne Power and the Divination of Fun https://youtu.be/ELo279fyc3Y\nByrne Power's Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIAtCuzdvgNJvSYILnHtdWA\nCharles Taylor A Secular Age https://amzn.to/36sQbkf\nCS Lewis Mere Christianity https://amzn.to/2RvpQxR\nUnbelievable Justin Brierley Peter Kreeft CS Lewis Argument from Desire https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Peter-Kreeft-debates-the-argument-from-desire-Unbelievable\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/313LKeL\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
