He grew up Canadian Reformed (offshoot of the CRC), now married with a couple of kids. He's a carpenter but just finished an MA in Philosophy doing a Master's Thesis on Kierkegaard and Faith (see link below).  \n\nRobert's Master's Thesis Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkaKH580OVvAWXq2NeL6YejHyTzJ2skEcCB022CByFY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNotes from the talk\nCanadian Reformed\nMasters in Philosophy\r\n\nDiscord server\r\n\nJordan Peterson\r\n\nSome ontological problem but you know they don\u2019t care\r\n\nJBP and Zizek were taking things seriously\r\n\nHe actually cares. \r\n\nPolitical stuff was important too\r\n\nThe way JBP is received in University was not well\r\n\nPhilosophy department already disposed to mock and put down anything that might take pseudo-intellectual. \r\n\nZizek is in exactly the same position, even a weirder position. \r\n\nPushes all the right buttons and they just wish he\u2019s push a couple more\r\n\nLion King and Pinochio\r\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a savior/hero for him\r\n\nFound him very endearing. \r\n\nNietzsche \r\n\nKierkegaard, what is faith? Fear and trembling\r\n\nThree spiritual states into 3: \r\n\n\r\n\n1. infinite resignation putting the world to death, \r\n\n\r\n\n2. The demonic, something that isn\u2019t that well laid out but in Sickness unto death, using a pseudonym, ends up being willing in despair to be yourself, Despair is a state that comes after consciousness, the serpent tempts the woman and they fall into sin, the beginning of consciousness, they have both fallen into despair by willing to be themself with their sin (Cain) remains the murderer. Persists in himself as a murderer. That is the demonic. Active despair, you know you\u2019ve done evil. You do it anyway. You persist in being yourself. Will to not be yourself. Despair and you don\u2019t will. Not willing to be yourself, \u201cthe feminine form of despair\u201d. An inaction. Satan in paradise lost. He is defiant the entire time. Untethered rationality. Builds a kingdom in hell with his pure intellect. Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven. The mind is in its own place to make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven. Taking action against God. CS Lewis talks about that in the Great Divorce. The little man with the puppet on a chain. The person disappears under the weight of the thing that is himself. Doubling down on a thing that isn\u2019t you. \r\n\n\r\n\n3. Faith. Kierkegaard is trying to get to. Kierkegaard doesn\u2019t allow the pseudonoymous author to get to because faith is not a concept, it\u2019s trust in God. \r\n\n\r\n\nYou can learn what faith is by example. John the silent is trying to do that. You can\u2019t learn what faith is just by watching Abraham and Isaac. Faith isn\u2019t just one thing. \r\n\n\r\n\nIt\u2019s a relationship. You can\u2019t see it. The reason isn\u2019t specific to Isaac and Abraham. The question that it puts there. God is asking \u201cwhat is most important to you?\u201d Do you trust me more than anything else? Will you follow human reason or will you trust me? \r\n\n\r\n\nTrying desperately to figure out how this could possibly happen. You can\u2019t understand faith like that. Only from the inside. Only the faithful understands faith. \r\n\n\r\n\nKierkegaard is critical of everything\r\n\n\r\n\nPraising the construction of the life raft in full confidence it will never need to be used. \r\n\n\r\n\nNietzsche, did his best to try to start a new religion. \r\n\n\r\n\nJulian Young is good on Nietzsche , Nietzsche and the Meaning of Life. Biography of Nietzsche. \r\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
