 "description": "Obaid Omer emigrated from India to Canada in the 70s as a boy with his parents. He gave up the Islamic faith as a tween, got an education and eventually worked overseas for his early adult life working in a variety of war torn places. When he returned to Canada the country in his words he didn't recognize his country. It went from Martin Luther King Jr's standard of judging people on the content of their character to judging them on the color of their skin.\n\nHe told a lot of his story to Andrea https://youtu.be/HLfZ40B810w\nObaid's Podcast. https://soundcloud.com/obaid-omer/tracks\nYou can find him on Twitter https://twitter.com/obaidomer\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
