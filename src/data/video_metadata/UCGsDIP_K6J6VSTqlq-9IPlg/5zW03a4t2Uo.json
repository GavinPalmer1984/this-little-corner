Of my JBP videos this one is my most autobiographical. https://youtu.be/GZR2xldACd0 I've always seen racism as a very big deal but I'm increasingly disturbed at how the fight against it is turning into a liturgy of self-righteous shaming. I think this is counter productive in the long run. \n\nPeterson is easily and commonly smeared on racism if he doesn't embrace the ascendant imagined SOLUTION to racism. Anti-racism is increasingly a religion of its own and if you fail to invoke the demanded liturgy you are denounced. This is a dangerous development because polarization will make matters worse. \n\nPeterson answer the question on racism in institutions as ONE factor among many in institutional tyranny.  It isn't the ONLY factor but if you talk this way the cult of anti-racism will denounce you for being insufficiently holy. \n\nHelpful reading is Scott Alexanders http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/ \n\nA post I wrote out of frustration https://paulvanderklay.me/2018/04/07/winning-awards-for-calling-out-the-big-sin/ \n\nThe original video
