Job and Mattias and Dave talked about this in a recent Randos convo. https://youtu.be/sZzyu66_HNs\n\nGroups like this don't just happen. They have to be grown. Even if they are growing people need support. John Van Donk wants to help leaders and potential leaders work through these things together. \n\nIf you're interested in being in this group here is the link to the application. https://forms.gle/9jB7keViHdB2L4er8\n\nThis conversation is not about teaching people what estuary is, and how to do it.. \nThat is a much more nebulous process, which is caught not taught\u2026\nDifferent instantiations are now happening online, such as the comment section of Paul\u2019s YouTube channel, or the Bridges of Meaning section of the Discord.\nBut it appears that at least some people feel a need to have conversations in the flesh, belly to belly, face to face, or as Job calls it, off-line.\nThere already are Meetup groups, for example, our own in Sacramento, and in Chino, and elsewhere. Sometimes we talk about ideas, at other times we talk about real life, about the challenges of making your bed, cleaning your room, taking responsibility, and how to navigate the suffering we encounter.\nThis conversation is not about creating some magic formula to make people do things they don't want to do.\nRather, for those people for whom YouTube or the Discord are no longer sufficient, we are trying to imagine ways to create spaces where they can go.\nAnd those places will not come into existence without leaders.\nSo, this is about finding, and mobilizing, leaders...\n\nHere's a document with a longer description. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1boPBz23J3NXnDjCFSs4M0o3AkwV6sTpXXdMFXc_ym0s/edit?usp=sharing\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
