JBP argues that people have a limited capacity for transformations in them. Transformations are tremendously costly for people but vitally important. \n\nThe need for personal transformations is being prompted by the massive transitions we are undergoing as a culture due to technological disruption. This started in the Protestant Reformation where Protestantism replaced the monastic system in much of Europe and in the Americas with a vision for the city replacing the monastery. As Modernity recedes Protestantism goes into crisis. \n\nThe path forward is likely a new monasticism as we're beginning to see in the church, but monasticism will only be part of the answer.
