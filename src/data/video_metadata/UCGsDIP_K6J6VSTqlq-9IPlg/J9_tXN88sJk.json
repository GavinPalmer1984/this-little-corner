 "description": "\u200b@Rebel Wisdom did a video interview with Jonathan Rowson. Rowson did an interview with Jordan Peterson right after the Cathy Newman interview that really launched @Jordan B Peterson to new heights of fame and public notoriety. Here David Fuller and Rowson do some processing of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon now 3 years later. I think there were some key things going on and doing the commentary afforded me some new insight. \n\nJordan Petersonitis https://youtu.be/tr_PzpqQzeE\nJordan Peterson and Jonathan Rowson RSA Interview https://youtu.be/OD-VCRNIp-U\nJordan Peterson Cathy Newman Full Interview https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54\nJordan Peterson Andrew Klavan https://youtu.be/p0s7NKwbNSY\nFrom Ross Douthat, Tara Isabella Burton and Steven Smith on the next American religion. https://youtu.be/WIttJNroGyM around minute 35\nSorkin letter to daughter https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/aaron-sorkin-donald-trump-president-letter-daughter\n\"I'm an asset, not a liability\" https://paulvanderklay.substack.com/p/im-an-asset-not-a-liability\nHard lines and Grime Lines: Why We Trust Grimy Stories https://youtu.be/oiyTfN3gRjg\n\n Discord link.
