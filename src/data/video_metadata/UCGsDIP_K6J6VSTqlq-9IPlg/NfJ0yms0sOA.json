Karen is an artist who sees that there always needs to be an element of the random so that order doesn't get tyrannical. They with Ari had a very interesting conversation about Austrian economics. Ari and Karen are Christians who believe in a personal God, Karl is now. Where do the lines fall around their belief systems? \n\nI also bring in a fascinating conversation between Peter Thiel and William Hurlbut on death. Both Thiel and Hurlbut identify as Christians. Hurlbut gives a lovely illustration of the complexity of the human body and the limits of what humanity will likely accomplish. \n\nChauncey Wright was part of the Metaphysical Club that with Pierce and James launched American Pragmatism. Wright believed that all there is is complicatedness but human perception is limited and so the difference  between religious belief and irreligion is a wash. \n\nIf this is the case, however, a guy like Rationality Rules is really in trouble because rationality itself falls or at least falls into pragmatism. It doesn't really afford with Rat Rules says it does or wants it to. \n\nKaren Wong's French Connection https://youtu.be/9OG17kp8FnA\nPeter Thiel and William Hurlbut https://youtu.be/qYSnVR7d4VE\nRationality Rules on the Joker https://youtu.be/UgAFqWo7Cis\nThe Metaphysical Club https://amzn.to/33Z7hpp\nSlate Star Codex https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
