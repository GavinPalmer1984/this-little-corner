 "description": "A bit more on @Jordan B Peterson Q/A from May 1 2011. https://youtu.be/Q-geMoCsNAw\n\nJordan was asked for a critique of Jung, but along the way he gave a rather nice observations from his practice regarding the manner in which personality profiles intersect with religion. \n\nI think about the fact that I can't remember him recommending therapy very often while he often talks about how he would treat someone. Is this part or the reason for his reluctance to participate in church? \n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
