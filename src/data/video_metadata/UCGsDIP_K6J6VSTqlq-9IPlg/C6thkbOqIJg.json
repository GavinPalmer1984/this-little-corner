John Van Donk has been here from the beginning with this. He's got questions and is demanding answers. I do my best. \n\n\n\nhttps://onepeterfive.com/things-are-broken-we-need-to-upgrade-our-sense-making-apparatus/ \n\nAbout the host\nWhat sort of leadership is necessary or helpful? (aware of, and comfortable with, protocol)\nIn pvk\u2019s estuary PVK himself embodies the connection between church and estuary\u2026\nNot so in Chino\u2026\nWhat if the senior pastor sees his role as the protector of the walled garden? What must he do to empower the host of the local estuary?\nNot every congregation has a John Vandonk\nIs some form of credibility within the local church necessary? Helpful?\n\nAbout the Estuary protocol\nMutual respect\nOpenness\nAbility to listen\nWillingness to first fully understand before \u201cjudging\u201d or critiquing\ne.g. Ryan Bennett\nWhen you pursue truth instead of power, you are in the IDW.\nWhen you favor understanding over judgment, you are in the IDW.\nWhen you value ideas more than identity, you are in the IDW.\nCan the protocol (see below), inherent in, and necessary for, estuary, be taught? If so, how, where, and by whom?\nAndrea with the Bangs complained that the guys at the IDW do not do a great job empowering the grassroots to carry the flag\u2026\nIs there a role for PVK here?\n\nAbout the space/location\nIs it important, or even necessary, for the estuary space to be associated with a local church? Any church?\npvk \u201cEvery church should have an estuary\u201d\njvd  \u201cEvery church \u201ccan\u201d have an estuary?\nHow might location influence participation, and/or behavior?\nI am thinking about changing location from clubhouse to church campus\u2026\nWhy? \nWhy not?\nIf an estuary does not flow forth from a local church, can it still be an estuary? Can an estuary flow forth from a mosque?  From a Buddhist temple? From a local secular humanist society?\n\nAbout how damming the estuaries was a uniquely Dutch invention.  Which turned out to be problematic.\n\nAbout another Dutch invention: Baggeren (dredging). Our mutual friend Job is from Sliedrecht, the dredging capital of the world.\nOpening the waterways in the estuary so traffic, both of water and of ships, is made easier.\nWhat can be done to make it easier for people within the church to discover the estuary?\nWhat can be done for people outside the church to discover the estuary? \nPR, Marketing, promotion...\nHowever, c.f also John McPhee The Control of Nature, especially chapter 1 \u201cAtchafalaya\u201d. (Job almost killed the entire estuary enterprise before it even started, by bringing \u201cbaggertjes\u201d)\n\nCelebrity\nPaul can draw a crowd\nRoad trip\nWhen Paul leaves, the crowd leaves with him\nStatus in the estuary...\n \nHow are words like \u201cTruth\u201d and \u201cdogma\u201d problematic?\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
