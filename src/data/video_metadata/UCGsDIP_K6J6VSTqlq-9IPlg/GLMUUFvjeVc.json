 "description": "Most wealthy liberals live Puritan lives (gaining wealth) but preach a libertine lifestyle. Peterson lives a Puritan life (faithful to one wife, faithful to his children) and is excoriated for preaching his brand of Puritanism. \n\nPeterson's interview on BBC3 with Dodd exposed both men's view of how the world can be saved. There are competing views of Marxism, but beneath it all are worldviews and implicit religions. \n\nPeterson and Dodd https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/arts-and-ideas/id140685432 \n\nThe Sex and the City Lifestyle https://nypost.com/2018/06/02/dating-columnist-reveals-how-sex-and-the-city-ruined-her-life/ \n\nQuick to Listen https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/quick-to-listen/ \n\nAudio podcast version of this. http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/ and https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333\n\nIf you want to support this channel https://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay",
