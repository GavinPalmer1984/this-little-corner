The Patriarchs lived in a sort of semi-civilized \"wild-west\" of a region where the moral imaginary was socially enforced because there wasn't an over-arching imperial authority. The Mosaic covenant creates a moral imaginary that changes the context. \n\nPortal with Douthat https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563\nDouthat the Decadent Society https://amzn.to/3cBPg4z\nPeter Thiel Eric Metaxas Zero to One https://youtu.be/SO_00POR-Po\nZero to One https://amzn.to/3eSir5x\nhttps://bibleproject.com/\nAncient Near East Thought and the Conceptual World of the Bible https://amzn.to/2zcVMkj\nA Secular Age https://amzn.to/2X3tz7q\nRichard Dawkins on Unbelievable https://youtu.be/p5_0Fx_RICI\nNuminous https://youtu.be/KlLzjk96qdE\nThe Problem of Pain https://amzn.to/2LmKv4a\nThe Problem of Pain Audio https://amzn.to/2N5z7vG\nThe Idea of the Holy https://amzn.to/2LnXwdz\nCS Lewis' List https://amzn.to/2A53ucS\nMy name is Earl White Lie Christmas https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6qauqe\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
