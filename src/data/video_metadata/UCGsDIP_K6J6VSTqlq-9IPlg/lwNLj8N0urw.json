 "description": "This week's 3 hour video was likely too much for a number of you stomach. The point is that while religiosity has become the dividing line of empty-public-square status it is inevitable to manifest itself one way or another back into human behavior. A recent video by Scott Adams has him sounding increasingly like a simulationist Jordan Peterson. While Peterson is a scientist, Adams is a hypnotist. \n\nPeter Boghossian Tweet https://twitter.com/peterboghossian/status/1260280861020184576\nReligiosity as IDW Final Frontier https://youtu.be/Mbz3OPZP0EI\nRyan Holiday 7 Keys to Stoicism https://youtu.be/g0lmSRCSGIU\nThe Un-necessary Pastor of the IDW https://youtu.be/LOfgcFh27nk\nCharles Taylor A Secular Age https://amzn.to/35sL1pR\nAndrew Root The Pastor in a Secular Age https://amzn.to/3aY7GeO\nOn the Road with St. Augustine https://amzn.to/2z7fi12\nTransubstantiation Book https://amzn.to/2KUBazp\nUpload Trailer https://youtu.be/0ZfZj2bn_xg\nRoss Douthat with Eric Weinstein on Portal https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/30-ross-douthat-the-rave-before-the-fall/id1469999563?i=1000471686956\nJordan Peterson Death and Resurrection https://youtu.be/xPIanlF6IwM\nScott Adams user interface https://youtu.be/9Ay_P4ze9EU\nRed Pilled American Let there be light https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/let-there-be-light/id1439503686?i=1000474068139\nJordan Peterson Personality 12 https://youtu.be/11oBFCNeTAs\nJordan Peterson Choose your Sacrifice https://youtu.be/ZjI7vqizTRc\nHope for Living Stoners https://youtu.be/TSm719HdswU\nRoss Douthat The Decadent Society https://amzn.to/2WwRHQW\nAmerica Grace Robert Putnam https://amzn.to/35PPoLJ\nUnbroken by Laura Hildebrand https://amzn.to/2Z7Zru2\nJohn Vervaeke Inevitable Religio https://youtu.be/FdZlQYtIJ0Q\nNassim Talib Skin in the Game at Google https://youtu.be/uv6KLbkvua8\nThe Last Battle CS Lewis https://amzn.to/2AurMAR\nMere Christianity CS Lewis https://amzn.to/3ctzKbu\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
