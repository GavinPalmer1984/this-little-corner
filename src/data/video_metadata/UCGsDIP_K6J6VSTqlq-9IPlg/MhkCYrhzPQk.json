Human beings find themselves alone in a sea of dead, unconscious matter and it is causes us a crisis of meaning. We deconstructed everything down to ourselves. We dissect the world, dissect ourselves but wonder who holds the knife. Owen Barfield had some incredibly important insights into this process that need far more attention. Malcolm Guite, an Anglican Priest has given some fine lectures on this. I'll use him to explore Barfield in this video.  \n\nMalcolm Guite https://youtu.be/8_v9vX4y0Cg\nLen Vander Zee Biologos the Big Story https://youtu.be/ZqgnJ1GR8ms\nThinkBigAnimation
