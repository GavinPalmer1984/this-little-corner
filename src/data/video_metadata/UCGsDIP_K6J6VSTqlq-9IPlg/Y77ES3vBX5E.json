 "description": "Rationality rules is still complaining about Jordan Peterson. Why? At least he's being fair, recognizing that Jordan is very careful about his speech. His crime? Not joining the religious/moral bandwagon. What he doesn't realize is that Jesus go smuggled long ago and he echos centuries of Christian preachers complaining about Christian insufficiency in living out Jesus' love ethic. \n\nThis is a short version. The long version contains the majority of the good faith conversation I had with Vaush where we explore some aspects of this ethic. \n\nIs Jordan Peterson Smuggling Jesus? https://youtu.be/on0Lziov00Y\nRichard Dawkins on Unbelievable https://youtu.be/p5_0Fx_RICI\nJordan Peterson at Lafayette College https://youtu.be/V32WHDuy-Do\nCS Lewis the Abolition of Man https://amzn.to/37yTCqn\nChristian Smith Soul Searching https://amzn.to/3bJYTyH\nThe Political Captivity of the Faithful https://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/the-political-captivity-of-the-faithful/\nDurability of Secular Humanism #1 https://youtu.be/3JLcoykfcNo\nDurability of Secular Humanism #2 https://youtu.be/7VJWRE8n3C0\nCan Atheism Save? https://youtu.be/RddIXMZQi3o\nJohn Gray Humanism and Morality https://youtu.be/vkVau46LsHE\nTom Holland Delingpod https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nTom Holland Glen Scrivener https://youtu.be/a0xCs2EfiXA\nGlen Scrivener Matt Dillahunty https://youtu.be/B3-sjyDYO2I\nThe Ideas of Rene Girard https://amzn.to/37y6eho\nModern Debates Has Jordan Peterson Hurt more than Helped https://youtu.be/LAUgExXyez4\nOn Vaush's channel https://youtu.be/BnTDNC3U7N0",
