I don't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.\u201d\n\nDoes the existence of suffering implicate the creator in evil? \n\nThe Brother's Karamazov https://amzn.to/37NbNuo\nThe Alchemy of Air https://amzn.to/3oB9dOP\n\nPo's channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanlsRNBJGgtGaRN7tzJsAQ\n\nTalk Notes\nWoman in ABBA wrote a song when she was 8 months pregnant\n\nAnti-natalists, a philosophy of trying to prevent suffering by encouraging people to not have children\n\nIs this a moral thing to do? Bringing a human being into the world knowing they will suffer\n\nTheological question rather than a scientific one. \n\nCan't satisfy it rationally\n\nBrothers Karamazov \n\nThe problem of suffering is addressed by justification. \n\nWhy should I want to be with such a God? He wants to return his ticket and deny God's benevolence. He could not justify this creation. All of the benevolence of the world could not justify the universe. \n\nStoicism: saving from suffering\n\nChef: films without conflict\n\nWhat is the opposite of suffering? \n\nSatisfaction\n\nJustification of much abortion is implicit anti-natalism\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
