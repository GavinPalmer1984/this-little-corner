Robert Putnam demonstrates this in his book American Grace. The major cultural change in the United States is the segregation of the obviously religious from an imagined naked public space. \n\nNow while Sam Harris continues his crusade to banish religiosity Eric and Bret Weinstein among a host of others see the need to replace what religions provided for the masses. The condition, of course, is an imagined rationality that excludes what is commonly asserted as the supernatural. \n\nMuch of what is being proposed to fill the place are pre-Christian religious or philosophical traditions with an unconscious Christian/humanist moral overlay. What happens to that overlay as the religious substrata continues to erode? \n\nRyan Holiday with Eric Weinstein on The Portal https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/31-ryan-holiday-conspiracy-manipulation-other-pastimes/id1469999563\n\nEric and Bret Weinstein and the End of History https://youtu.be/xkuw8dDAThA\nThe Un-necessary Pastor of the IDW https://youtu.be/LOfgcFh27nk\nJordan Peterson Prayer from a Skeptic POV https://youtu.be/2hG7o0ihIkE\nWhy relate to a personal God with John Vervaeke https://youtu.be/65CcfvXXHug\nInfinitesimals https://youtu.be/d3aFCtt6HgQ\nAmerican culture as cargo cult https://youtu.be/_c7uy6NLIM8\nA Secular Age https://amzn.to/2LiX8fG\nRyan Holiday Conspiracy https://amzn.to/2WjmRLp\nTwilight of the American Enlightenment George Marsden https://amzn.to/2WiHpnb\nAmerica Grace Robert Putnam https://amzn.to/35PPoLJ\nHail Caesar Trailer https://youtu.be/JRqKieJzCeo\nLogos made Flesh convo https://youtu.be/rAlmXRJt0u8\nJordan Peterson at Lafayette College https://youtu.be/qT_YSPxxFJk\nRyan Holiday 7 Keys to Stoicism https://youtu.be/g0lmSRCSGIU\nCS Lewis Miracles https://amzn.to/2Aig10b\nGreg Sadler Pascal Spirit of Geometry Spirit of Finesse https://youtu.be/VSIGf-aAYPM\nJames Tour Unbelievable Lee Cronin https://youtu.be/3DHvNRK452c\nJordan Peterson Sam Harris Bret Weinstein Vancouver 1 https://youtu.be/d-Z9EZE8kpo\nVerizon Lisa https://youtu.be/hhHAeAObzzk\nEric Weinstein Ross Douthat Portal 30 https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/30-ross-douthat-the-rave-before-the-fall/\nTom Holland Delingpod https://youtu.be/R8J2aChrf7Q\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/3fFJJfB\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
