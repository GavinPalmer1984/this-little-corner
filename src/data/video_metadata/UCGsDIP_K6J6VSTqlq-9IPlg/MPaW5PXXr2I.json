 "description": "On Nov 21 Bret tweeted a response to the fact that #JesusistheSonofGod was \"unironically\" trending. He asked \"Is there an competing hastag for heretics?\"  Andrea with Bangs pointed out these tweets to me on the Discord server and I saw that Esther and Eric had already engaged. \n\nBret got triggered by the hashtag and Christians like me got triggered by the \"Magical\" word and the discussion was on. This lines up with my sermon this week. I'm not sure I'll do a Rough Draft or count this one as such. \n\nBret's Tweets\nhttps://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1197574309213917189\nhttps://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1197583734490288128\n\nThe Powerpoint https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kuFqaL3jZ6lfKsBU9pU5AHIENgz-Ghib/view?usp=sharing\n\nTimothy Snyder's Black Earth https://www.amazon.com/Black-Earth-Holocaust-History-Warning/dp/1101903473\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2D7TUYo\nCS Lewis Signature Classics https://amzn.to/349S4lH\nCS Lewis Grand Miracle Doodle https://youtu.be/Uv4kx2QP4UM\nBret Weinstein and Alister McGrath Unbelievable https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nMy blog post on that conversation. https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Unbelievable-blog/Bret-Weinstein-s-blind-spot.-If-you-want-to-fix-the-world-you-can-t-escape-religion\nAlister McGrath Heresy https://amzn.to/37x6xKv\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
