It was clear from the downstream chatter that it was fresh and spicy. I was busy Sunday morning so I didn't get a chance to pursue it deeply but I figured the Petersons must have disagreed with it because they released the recordings of the interviews. The whole thing is really helpful in terms of not only getting a sense for how the Petersons see their world but also how the idealized idolatrous image of our culture colonizes us all. As I made the video the symbolism of Daniel 3 emerged so I ran with it. \n\nThe Times on Jordan Peterson https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jordan-peterson-depression-drug-dependency-daughter-mikhaila-rehab-russia-0xtz2ph32\nUnedited Times Interview https://youtu.be/Fd2wKn6-X_A\nhttps://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism\nMikhaila's Response video https://youtu.be/mmk6aESKYWE\n\n\n\nJBP on his blog about the interview. https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/blog-posts/the-sunday-times-interview-request-and-my-response/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
