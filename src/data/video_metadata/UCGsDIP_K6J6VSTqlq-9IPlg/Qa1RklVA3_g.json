Organizer of the European Men's Gathering, Paul Lloyd Robson speaks to Pastor and Jordan Peterson commentator Paul VanderKlay about the aspects of Jesus as an archetype. Particularly we explore his relevance in helping men to find their contributive role and take responsibility, while balancing their identity between masculine and feminine virtues.\n\nFind more information about the European Men's Gathering at www.maniphesto.com/emg.
