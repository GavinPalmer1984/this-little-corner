 "description": "Job, Jeff and Luke were some of my earliest listeners who reached out to me for conversation. You can many of their talks on my channel. About a year ago I limited the repetition of talks to 2. When I did that these guys started their own YouTube Channel \"Randos United\". Job also has become \"the pastor of the discord server\" where he conducts similar conversations with those who watch the channel. We got together for a 2 hour chat which will likely get us all in trouble. \n\nPrevious conversation with the 4 of us https://youtu.be/mHBVLEthbgk\nFirst Conversation with Luke https://youtu.be/0XJG2qoO6hM\nSecond conversation with Luke https://youtu.be/DSiCZLHkZXA\nThe Job Playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSXopxC8Z9to_1IQWB9gNjYaRfzvPLad \nFirst Conversation with Jeff https://youtu.be/JoAHv6_LG_w\n\nNotes \nRandos United channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzWTLDYmL8soRdQec9Fsjw\n\nJeff Quackenbush\u2019s Challenge https://youtu.be/yDOqQv6wUg8\n\nLuke on his soapbox\n\nCale posted this video https://youtu.be/8tQ66A_THKo\n\nJohn Behr, Orthodox church\n\nWhat have I learned in the last 2 years\n\nBruce Charlton what we\u2019ve learned from modernity http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/11/what-we-are-supposed-to-learn-from.html\n\nGuy Sengstock https://youtu.be/qMyACsMlNMs \n\nJeff is the Dave Rubin of the discord\n\nDiabetes inducing songs about Jesus\n\nDiscord podcast https://bridgesofmeaning.podbean.com/\n\n4 P Vervaeke https://paulvanderklay.me/2020/01/10/vervaeke-4-ps-of-knowing-via-surok-on-discord/\n\nA Grief Observed https://amzn.to/2OIfGby\n\nCS Lewis the Trouble with X https://noeljesse.com/the-trouble-with-x-by-c-s-lewis/\n\nFrom God in the Dock https://amzn.to/2tO78Zn \n\nGood faith discussions\n\nRule 9 of 12 Rules for Life Jordan Peterson\n\nA fancy Vervaeke word for what I\u2019m describing\n\nThe more direct control I have the more I will trust myself\n\nLaurus https://amzn.to/31IFdGG\n\nWierd Al Constipated Legos song https://youtu.be/dRC9xEGIiHU\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
