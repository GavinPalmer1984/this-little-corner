This was one of them. \nWhy the NY Times doesn\u2019t understand why people would be interested in Religion.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/nyregion/converting-catholics-church-scandal.html\n\nCan generosity be commanded? \nPeople want no rules in church\nChurch as a voluntary organization\nI don\u2019t know anybody who believes in the resurrection of the body who didn\u2019t go to seminary\nYou have this toolbox that you are constantly adding to\nYou use different ideas in church\nPeople\u2019s positions on stuff are revealed by how they act, write or speak passively than actively\nIf everything is expressive, there should not be any rules\nThe statements they are saying are propaganda\nEpistemology that the church teaches Christianity has is so unclear\nDefends itself by critiquing the critique\nWhat do people mean when they say the word \u201cGod\u201d\nSo many of the pastors are on their back foot but I don\u2019t know what they mean by their terms\nYou grow up with an idea that God is just a big one of us.\nMetaphysics in Christianity have seen a distinct lack of focus\nChristians don\u2019t really know what they are saying when they say \u201cgod exists\u201d\nWhat is a Christian epistemology?\nWhat we mean when we say \u201cI believe that Jesus is Lord\u201d \n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes
