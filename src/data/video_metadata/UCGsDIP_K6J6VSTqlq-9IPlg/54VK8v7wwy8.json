 "description": "Every Friday I do a Q/A session on the Bridges of Meaning Discord server. To participate you can join here. https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\n\n\n0:00  I've been thinking a lot about our notions of masculinity and femininity in the church. A lot of young men in my church (including me) are big fans of guys like Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink, Jordan Peterson, etc. who embody a certain vision or vibe of masculinity. What do you think the church can learn from these figures? Why do they have the appeal that they have? What conclusions might we reach, given the relative absence of men from the church at large?\n22:00 The privilege of the under-privileged \n\n27:00 Men who are miserable because of lack of community. \n\n37:00 JBP\u2019s self-authoring program. I can\u2019t produce the vision for someone else. \n\n42:00 Hagia Sophia returned into a mosque. Restoration of the temple? Physical sanctuaries in our spiritual life. Spaces vs hearts. \n\n54:40 What to do when you lose someone you love? Grief. \n\n1:08:32 Living Stones Online and Estuary \n\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
