 "description": "CS Lewis abandoned Christianity in his youth. After he was established in Oxford he began to believe with the help of JRR Tolkien. Their interest in mythology and Christianity as \"the true myth\" changed CS Lewis' life completely. It was the emphasis on meaning that, like those listening to Jordan Peterson, brought Lewis to consider Christianity and made him into the most effective apologist in the 20th century English speaking world. \n\nAlister McGrath's biography of Lewis https://www.amazon.com/C-S-Lewis-Eccentric-Reluctant-ebook/dp/B008PX0GPI\n\nAlan Jacob's biography of Lewis https://www.amazon.com/Narnian-Life-Imagination-C-Lewis-ebook/dp/B000FCKH7O/ \n\nCS Lewis Mere Christianity https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-Lewis-Signature-Classics-ebook/dp/B002BD2UR0 \n\nGeorge Marsden's \"biography\" of Mere Christianity https://www.amazon.com/Lewiss-Mere-Christianity-Biography-Religious-ebook/dp/B017I2M87K \n\nThe Fellowship (of the Inklings) https://www.amazon.com/Fellowship-Literary-Inklings-Barfield-Williams-ebook/dp/B00PF6QL1G/",
