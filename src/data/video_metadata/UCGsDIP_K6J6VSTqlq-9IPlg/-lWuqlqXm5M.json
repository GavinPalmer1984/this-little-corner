A generation of young people in the affluent, secular west which is more secure, prosperous and opportunity laden is anxious, depressed and reluctant to commit to a lifelong relationships or bring children into the world. Their worldview only affords help from within humanity but they fear that political solutions that allow freedom don't afford the technical solutions they assert the world needs. \n\nAdvent is the beginning of the Christian year. It asserts that help comes from the LORD who offers what is impossible for us to imagine can arise from among us. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
