 "description": "Dr. Brett Salkeld is the Archdiocesan Theologian for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina Saskatchewan and the author of \"Transubstantiation: Theology, History and Christian Unity\". You might assume that this is simply a book about a historical theological dispute, and it is, but I think this book is a clear presentation of the history of the conflict surrounding our understanding of the word \"God\". We use the word \"God\" as if we know what we're talking about, or that we all mean the same thing when we say the word. I'm convinced we don't and I believe this conflict is at the heart of the great falling away of the church in the West. Brett and I get into this along with a lot of the issues I deal  with on this channel. \n\nBrett has a podcast https://archregina.sk.ca/thinkingfaith\nWebsite https://archregina.sk.ca/archdiocesan-theologian\n\nTransubstantiation book on Amazon https://amzn.to/2uZVqeA\nHis book on Purgatory https://amzn.to/32crfgt\nJohn Vervaeke Awakening from the Meaning Crisis https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ\nChristine Hayes Yehezkiel Kaufman and the Metadivine Realm https://youtu.be/wRPqtGywkCw\nYehezkel Kaufmann the Religion of Israel https://amzn.to/2SZ6BMJ\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/3bPZoHo\nTom Holland in the Shadow of the Sword https://amzn.to/2SK3OZ2\n\nNotes \nDiaconate formation program\nFlannery\nHomeschooling\nPermanent Deacon and Transitional Deacon\nSacramentally represent to the Christian community between worship and service\n4 year program, evenings and weekends\nPurgatory, master\u2019s thesis\nDating and Sexuality\nDoctoral dissertation\nHow our God language shifted\nShift after Thomas, between Thomas and the Reformation\nShift before Thomas\n\n\n\n\nEveryone culturally was a platonist\nWhen that breaks down, in the West\nThe church is trying to figure out what was easy for a platonist to say but hard for someone in europe to say in the 9th to the 11th century\nTransubstantiation emerges to say just that\nSubstance becomes the prime category\nWhen we say real we hear physical\nWe realize there is a deeper reality than the physical\nThe deeper reality, as persisting even though some of those things change\nSubstance is what Aquinas finds in Aristotle, before Aquinas\n4th lateran council\nThe difference is greater than the similarity\nThis starts to break down after Thomas in the nominalist school\nThere\u2019s a category beyond god which we call being\nThere is a god \u201cin the system\u201d which can be measured with other things in the system\nOne actor\u2019s will is in conflict with another actor\u2019s will\nFruit of the vine and the gift of the hands\nPeople are finding their transcendence in political movements\nFunctional definition of religions\nYour religion is what you will sacrifice anything else for\nDavid foster Wallace\nThe non-competitive god that is not in the system\nWill ask for sacrifices that put you in harmony with the rest of the system\nSelf-sacrifice even for the sake of your enemy\nPuts you in a peaceful order with creation\nWe\u2019ve reverted to sacrificial power games\nEucharist is the peaceful sacrifice\nLuther is trying to speak Thomas\nChristine Hayes\nHistorical events for good or ill are the manifestations of that god\u2019s will\nTom Holland rise of Islam\nThe real religious intolerance is the sacralizing of the political\nRene Girard\nNietzsche had it first\nJordan Peterson\nJohn Vervaeke\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
