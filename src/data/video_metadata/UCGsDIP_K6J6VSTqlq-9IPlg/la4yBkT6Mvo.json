Register with my sister Ruth (Anne Clay). Payments to her.\n\nWhere: North East Connecticut. Fly into Boston MA or Providence RI. Specific address information at registration. \n\nIt\u2019s a rustic, cozy setting. If you want to see my sister and her husband decorate and fix up the old Russian Bear watch her YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2zbBGVzhx9yKkx__ILIrw\n\nTo Register email my sister at quinnbrookfarm@gmail.com\n\nLimit is 30 guests, first come first serve.\n\nThere are limited accommodations onsite.
