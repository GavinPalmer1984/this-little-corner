 "description": "Fascinating conversation with Karam. What is religion as risk management? Jordan Peterson got close to it with Sam Harris but not quite there. Nasim Taleb's work comes in. Also Chesterton's Fence. \n\nNotes \nHasim Taleb\u2019s work\nImplications of religion over generations\nJBP and Sam Harris\n\nHow JBP would mention the importance of an embodied individual to act in the world and not just have beliefs. One of the gaps was the simple notion of going to church on Sunday. \n\nAtheists who enroll their children in Catholic school. \nThat priest really believed what he was doing. \nNasim Talib writes about. \nReligion as risk management. \nHow do I insure the survival of my offspring throughout time?\n\nGlimpse of that in some conversations, Risk management through government\n\nRisk was not being properly addressed. \nLoaded gun analogy, that\u2019s risk management\nMetaphorical truth is risk management\nStill part of him that is \u201csuperstitious\u201d can\u2019t point the gun\n\nRisk of losing your life, and losing your identity\n\nNeed to act differently towards those \n\nThere is something about the religion that maintains order, community, other stuff, whether you understand what it\u2019s doing\u2026 you\u2019re not smarter than tradition, certain milestones, this explains a lot about tradition, conflicts, \n\nSimple solutions to problems that you don\u2019t have to encounter in life. \n\nDon\u2019t want to risk \n\nChesterton\u2019s Fence\n\nPassage from isaiah, locking yourself in your home until the wrath passes\n\nIs Modernity flattening everything out so much that we think we have a handle on it. \n\nWe perceive it as being flattened out more than we think\n\nPeople don\u2019t believe that we need religion anymore\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.

Nassim jumped on him\n\nImmigrants, as they bring their religion with them, they lose a bit of their faith through the generations\n\nChristianity has something built into it that it disintegrates\n\nChristianity without God and without Jesus\n\nSecularization on the other religions\u2026\n\n\nAesthetics, go to a church because he enjoys the aesthetics\nNot a fluent speaker of arabic, also syriac\nThe sounds of the chanting\nNostalgia, imprinting \n\nAtheists haven\u2019t addressed that correctly\nThe test of time\nLeviticus\n\nThe atheists always bring up\n\nUsing the atheists to guide him through the Bible\n\nThat hero\u2019s journey is a call to action, Jordan Peterson was right\n\nPageau",
