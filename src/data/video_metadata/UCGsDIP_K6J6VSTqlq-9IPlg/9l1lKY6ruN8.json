She's been a regular on the Rando's channel and the Discord server and we sit down for our second conversation about being Christian and working in and with the church. \n\nA Grief Observed 2 (Randos) https://youtu.be/t0P6vb6p-eA\nSarah and Jeff (Randos) https://youtu.be/4Iiq5RihnAQ\nGrief Observed 3 (Randos) https://youtu.be/WrsJInvreWs\nGrief Observed 5 (Randos) https://youtu.be/NYQBj6c6W2E\nSarah and Julian (Randos) https://youtu.be/NQkDGOUbjwk\nNotes\nConversations with Jeff and Julian on the Randos channel\nFour points that have impacted her\nNeed them to be practical, we tend to live in our heads and that is futile\nRe-enchantment of the world she knew as a child\nFuller integration of Christianity into all areas of life\nDeveloping and cultivating meaning making practices\nCommunity of people seeking truth, goodness and beauty\n\nAs a child she lived in this magical world. The world was alive. As she grew older she distanced from that reality that shaped her so vividly. Went into a period of death and numbness. \n\nThrough church experiences was skeptical of experience itself. Involved in an unhealthy charismatic type church. People\u2019s experiences were whatever they wanted. Drifted towards reason. Go to the Bible as center of authority. Biblical rationalism\n\nChristianity felt more and more dead. Had a very enchanted side of her connected to poetry and music, etc. \n\nChurch drama around Biblical interpretation. \n\nThe role of reason has been to look back on experiences and use reason to know what experiences are in alignment with reality/truth/ etc. \n\nWhat role does reason play. \nVervaeke\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
