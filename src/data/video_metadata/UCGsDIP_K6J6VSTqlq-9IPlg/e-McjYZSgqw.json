They are upset because somehow they got the message allegedly from Paul that they somehow missed the Day of the Lord. Paul reminds them that he had talked about this but he doesn't share what he said. This has set up subsequent generations to speculate based on very little information here about what Paul might have said.\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
