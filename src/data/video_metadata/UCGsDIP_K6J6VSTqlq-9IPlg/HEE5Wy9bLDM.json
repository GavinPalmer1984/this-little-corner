 "description": "How Israel Flipped the Script on Marduk. Ancient Near East cultures worked polytheism and according to JBP they put together the gods. What happened however, when Babylon tried to absorb Judah? How did the prophet Ezekiel and the others flip the script to the degree that there are zero temples to Marduk today and millions of people praying to the God of the Bible? \n\nEzekiel, repetition and Israel flipping the script.
