 "description": "Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau and John Vervaeke all have regular Q/A sessions. I've not done this because I'm not a fan of nut and bolts of that and wanted to see if we could find a better way to do it. I think this might be an improvement. \n\nThe group that has gathered on the Bridges of Meaning Discord server has become a special community. https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU Doing the Q/A in this context seems to afford more of a flow of conversation. \n\nHere are the questions.  \n\n1. Will you talk to Preston Sprinkle\n2. Do atheists from non-Christian religions tend towards the kind of secular humanism proffered by Sam Harris, or do they find themselves in a different value structure due to a different cultural context? If the latter, are there any prominent examples of this?\n3. Do atheists from non-Christian religions tend towards the kind of secular humanism proffered by Sam Harris, or do they find themselves in a different value structure due to a different cultural context? If the latter, are there any prominent examples of this?\n4. Mercury: dump bathwater of virtue signaling without group prayer. \n5. Minneapolis riots and COVID lockdown\n6. Nietzsche: \n7. Question for @PVK : Much of the IDW related truce between Christians and Atheists seemed related to the shared enemy of \"wokeness\". If \"wokeness\" goes into decline, will this alliance fray?\n8. Where do you see hyper agency detection going on in the secular humanist frame right now?\n9. Are there similar abstractions of other religions, in the vein of what you're describing secular humanism to be vis a vi Christianity? Or has Christianity via globalism effectively suppressed/outcompeted such developments?\n10. @PVK Hello Pastor, hope you and your family is well. Question, or more of advice. I have a friend of mine, who's a pastor, thinking about starting up a \"Jordan Peterson meetups\" And since Jordan Peterson has been out of public discourse for awhile, is it good time to \"use\" Jordan's name for a meetup, or should we start something else? Thanks for your time and all that you do through YouTube channel.\n11. Job: be careful with whom you share good news and bad news\nAt this point Job saw in the General section of the discord the message from Voth's widow that he had passed away. We spent the rest of the time in silence. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
