 "description": "Kevin who I spoke with not long ago had a theological dispute with Steafon Fox over the devil. Steafon is part of the Boyos who talk Carl Jung, Jordan Peterson and Nietzsche over on their channel. We had little time and a confusion over scheduling but what came out was a sort of a while free-for-all conversation about Christian formation, notions of progress, Satan, antiquity, the Metadivine realm, God, predestination, you name it.
