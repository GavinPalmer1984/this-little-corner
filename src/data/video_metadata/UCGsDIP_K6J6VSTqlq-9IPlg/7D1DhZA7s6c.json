Peterson started an online feeding frenzy imagining he'd convert to Catholicism, or Orthodoxy, or something else, and of course he still could, but in his first Q/A in the second wave he answer the religion question pretty much like he's always done. Based on his answer he pretty much remains exactly where @Rationality Rules pegged him to be in this video about Jesus smuggling. https://youtu.be/on0Lziov00Y\n\nHere is the first Q/A this wave and he answers it as the first question. https://youtu.be/Q-geMoCsNAw\n\nDiscord link.
