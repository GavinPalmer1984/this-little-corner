 "description": "My church work is on another channel for a variety of reasons but often in my Sunday School class you can see the fruit of my labors in Jordan Peterson, John Vervaeke, and the Meaning Crisis. In this August 11 lesson in order to figure out what is happening in the version of the cleansing of the temple in the Gospel of John I give a lay treatment of the explanation of between original participation and non-participation.
