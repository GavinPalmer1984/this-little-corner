 "description": "Jordan Peterson and Tom Holland have changed Christian/Atheist debates. This was clearly seen in the Unbelievable matchup between Matt Dillahunty and Glen Scrivener. The New Atheists have for a decade now scored points challenging the Bible as failing to live up to contemporary moral standards of partisan culture war positions dismissing God as a fictional character like Santa Clause or the Tooth Fairy but what Holland and Peterson have shown is that this character as acted out in Jesus Christ was essential for the development of moral standards embraced across the culture war divide. Jesus Christ fulfilled the seeding of the Imago Dei in the book of Genesis and over the long march of the history of Western Civilization the culture has achieved a level of agreement over the value of human life even though we constantly fail to fully live it out or agree on the details. This debate plays out those themes. \n\nUnbelievable with Justin Brierley: Glen Scrivener and Matt Dillahunty https://youtu.be/B3-sjyDYO2I\nMy conversation with Voth https://youtu.be/_WqdrvNb8lI\nJordan Peterson Bib Series 10 on Piaget Equilabrated State https://youtu.be/3Y6bCqT85Pc\nBlood and Thunder by Hampton Sides https://amzn.to/2FQHG80\nNaming Indigenous American People Groups https://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/name.html\nTom Holland Dominion https://amzn.to/2tfExvy\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
