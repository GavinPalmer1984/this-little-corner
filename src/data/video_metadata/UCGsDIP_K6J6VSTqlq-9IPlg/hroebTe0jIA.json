 "description": "Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. A crowd is following him because they want to see what the confrontation between Jesus and the authorities in Jerusalem will provide. Along the way he eats various times with Pharisees and Teachers of the law. The conversations are testy. They complain because Jesus also eats with tax collectors and sinners. Jesus explains why.\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
