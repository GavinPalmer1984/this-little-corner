 "description": "Dr. Preston Sprinkle founded the Center for Faith, Sexuality and Gender. After a conversion experience he pursued his studies in the Bible from John MacArthur's Master's University and Seminary. It gave him a desire to study the Bible and hold true to its teachings rather than the doctrinal standards of that system. He got a PhD in New Testament from Aberdeen going on to teach first at Cedarville University then Francis Chan's Eternity Bible College. He has spent his career working to open up the Bible on controversial topics to where he currently helps churches and Christian institutions try to apply biblical teaching on sexuality to their circumstances. He has a podcast \"Theology in the Raw\". I was a guest on an episode about Jordan Peterson. Here we talk for nearly two hours examining his story and touching on both Christian culture and the culture beyond. \n\nCenter for Faith, Sexuality and Gender https://centerforfaith.com/\nTheology in the Raw Podcast https://www.prestonsprinkle.com/theology-in-the-raw\nHis episode with me https://www.prestonsprinkle.com/theology-in-the-raw/2019/3/11/729-a-conversation-with-paul-vander-klay\nPreston Sprinkle Books https://amzn.to/2XwvoJJ\n\nNotes \n\n43 years old, became a Christian at 19, wasn\u2019t naturally academic\nWisdom\nWent from hating to read\nJohn MacArthur sermons\nMasters University, majored in Bible\n1997 19 years old about to turn 20\nIn Israel a very conservative professor had them read liberal scholars\nWhy can\u2019t Evangelicals be Scholars?\nMaster\u2019s Seminary and PhD at Aberdeen \nReformed Dispensational Cessesionist\n\u201cThere is only one Seminary\u201d \nWayne Grudem\nHad to write an eschatology paper on 1 Thessalonians, main rapture prooftext\nWhat does the Bible actually say, even if I get fired. \nCedarville University\nViews on non-violence started to form, and God\u2019s heart for the poor and marginalized\nSimi Valley Bible College Francis Chan Eternity Bible College not at great cost\nWas writing academic books, \n2011 Rob Bell Love Wins\nFrancis Chan to write a book response to this\u2026\nSchool debt\nErasing hell, is Hell irreversible\nFell in love with the art of writing\nWrote a book on Non-violence, the Bible and warfare\nResearch and blogging on sexuality\nSince 1980 30 books on what the Bible says about same sex relationships, 27 say he doesn\u2019t condemn SS relationships\nThe Center for Faith, Sexuality and Gender\nProduce web based resources, video resources, small group curriculum, testimonial videos\nLeaders forum, one day thing\nWhat have you learned? \nPeople to be loved.
