Something has been bothering me, in a good way, about what you said in your prayer for Voth. \"I want to lend him my faith.\" -- this drove my individualist christian thought processes into a frenzy. I didn't know how to think about it or what angle to come at it from. Sunday I left church with my mother and she was relaying a story about a guy we talk to called Paul McCartney, not the Beetle. His family is christian but his daughter is married to an anti-theist. The question of 'why is she with him' cropped up. Then I recalled: For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Then the old adage: you can't get into heaven on your daddy's coattails. So I guess what I'm asking for here is where the biblical references for external sanctifying influences are supported.\n34:00 I'm finally reading The Brothers Karamazov. I just finished this section from book 2, chapter 2. It is a quote from the character Father Zossima:\nIt struck me how this quote might get at something at the core of today's social justice virus. I wonder if the onset of one's falling ill with the social justice virus is a deep, deliberate or not, lying to oneself. Is there anything in particular about this excerpt that you find reflects either some symptom or some cause of today's social woes?\n45:00 When discussing the Declaration of Independence, my US History professor (at sac city) just this week said \u201cpeople have tried to explain where we get our rights from something other than God. And none of those have ever proved to be credible or even acceptable. So, we always return back to God.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure you saw Bishop Barron\u2019s recent video on the topic as well. Do you think this is something to emphasize, or start with, when evangelizing?\n53:30 I have become sure it is impossible to prevent others from misinterpreting things I say/write, even when heard/read in good faith. I'm disappointed to conclude this but realize it's not practical to let my world depend on my perfection (to be attained in/after death).\nSo to continue in practicality, how have you thought about being clear as a person, pastor, and internet sensation? \n1:07:00 Non-traditional relationships. \n1:20:00 Are you willing to talk more in depth about your reservations about doing church online? Perhaps (as has been done with JBP groups) there could be a commitment to meet in person to foster the IRL connection you always emphasize?  I think the online push many in the church are participating in amidst the Covid era is largely seen as temporary but your idea of an Estuary (perhaps divorced from the \u201cchurch\u201d) I think could work well in my estimation. What are your thoughts? Thank you \n1:35:30 What credentials are necessary to share what you\u2019ve learned from God? \n1:40:00 James KA Smith to get to Estuary \n1:43:00 What in your opinion does the Christian hero look like in the face of evil that would do violence to have its way?  Since it appears that Christ did not take up or endorse violence in response to evil, and that's how he apparently defeated it, is the use of violence to fight evil a misread of what followers of Christ should do to ultimately play a part in Christ's victory?\n1:56:00 Collective responsibility or corporate responsibility Tim Keller\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
