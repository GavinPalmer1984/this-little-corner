 "description": "I've known @PastorTanner from the Bridges of Meaning Discord server but we haven't had a chance to chat much so I was excited when he snagged a Randos slot. \n\nYou can find his channel here. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChd0hykjVPnEZ-VecEAxC3A\n\nPastor of a small church in Colorado, Leadville\n\n2 years ago. Taking two classes in seminary\n\nJames KA Smith, You Are What You Love\n\nCarl Truman, \n\nRandos started interacting with the stream\n\nDoing the sermon preparation\n\nPlatforms\n\nReformed Theological Seminary: Reformed Baptist\n\nConstantly prodding with tests of orthodoxy.\n\nThe Christian Internet: \n\nCivil Disobedience and Christianity\n\nIncreasingly felt more and more isolated and alone\n\nWeaponized sheep\n\nRichard Cunningham CS Lewis Defender of the faith\n\nLewis Epistemology: Reason is the organ of truth\n\nImagination is the organ of meaning. \n\nAs manifest in allegory and myth. How you step into the light and see the trees and the sun. \n\nFor Lewis myth is more true. Just like JBP fiction is more true.\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
