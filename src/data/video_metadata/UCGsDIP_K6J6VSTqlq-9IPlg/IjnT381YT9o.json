 "description": "Why won't God break open the clouds and descend? His mission was instantiated in the temple and the covenant but Israel couldn't fulfill it. The destruction of the temple was a catastrophe of Israel's entire frame of reference. In Isaiah 40 God sends out his heavenly emissaries to announce a new day. The second temple period was not what Israel had been longing for. That temple too would be destroyed, but the Son of Man would be its replacement and smaller temples of Living Stones would move out throughout the world. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
