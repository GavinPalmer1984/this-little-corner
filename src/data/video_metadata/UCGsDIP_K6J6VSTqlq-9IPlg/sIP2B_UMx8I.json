He responded that he wouldn\u2019t and would rather be shot, because any attack on the Bible is an attack on one's own faith. What would you infer about this person's relationship with the Bible, and how is it different than your relationship with it? Thank you for your time\n49:45 Vervaeke Relevance Realization and God \n54:00 \"son of man\" controversy. \n1:03:00 anxiety\n1:07:00 JBP interview. \n1:10:00 Prayer for Jordan\n1:13:45 If someone has latched on to an ideology with fanatic fervor (parasitic possession?) how do you suggest promoting self-awareness within that individual (and ourselves) without assuming a role of threatening superiority or falling into similar blindness?\n1:17:00 Occasionally Paul, you will as an aside or a pre-amble to an answer or a commentary twitch the curtain aside to provide a glimpse into the behind fa\u00e7ade view of the world from the Pulpit. An example of this from a couple weeks ago was your emphasizing the Pastor's role as a gardener trying to nurture multi generation community health. Would you care to allow yourself to meander around in relating what kinds of experiences, lessons and perspectives you are uniquely rewarded by your role? Would you agree with 'emotional custodian' or 'psychic janitor' as atleast partial description of your duties?\n1:22:30 Hey Paul, I wanted to follow up on my previous question. Thank you for your rebuke of my conduct with my fundamentalist friend. It\u2019s such a stumbling block for me to not feel superior, which is so stupid of me to think that my intellect would put me in such a position. How would you recommend I combat this? Does this relate to Romans 14 and not putting stumbling blocks in my brother's way?\n1:30:00 Reading Judges. Gideon's strange choice of weapon.
