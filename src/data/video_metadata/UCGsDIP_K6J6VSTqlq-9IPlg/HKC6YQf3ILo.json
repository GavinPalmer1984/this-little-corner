 "description": "Before I started my YouTube channel I was very concerned that my denomination, the Christian Reformed Church was failing to have what I call confessional conversations. We were unable to accurately and graciously explore different theological positions in a public way. I have wanted to have on my channel a variety of conversations that people from many perspectives would find helpful for their own ability to work in the church. \n\n\n\nHere I put a brief introduction onto an existing video conversation between my friend Sam who describes himself as a Biblical Unitarian and Dr. Brett Salkeld who wrote the book Transubstantiation. After meeting both of them I very much wanted them to have a conversation because I had high confidence that they could do it well and I could learn from both of them. Now that they have done it I have not been disappointed. I think it is an outstanding example of a Confessional Conversation and because Sam's channel is small I wanted more people to see it. \n\n\n\nThe original conversation on Sam's Channel https://youtu.be/6LKTai_Sy9s\nMy first conversation with Sam: https://youtu.be/QuoqGzIu5Wc\nMy second conversation with Sam https://youtu.be/U-liJzoMvNY\nMy first conversation with Brett https://youtu.be/SloRs2yzmvo\nMy second conversation with Brett https://youtu.be/_NsDyNgF_3o\nBrett's Transubstantiation book https://amzn.to/2V6QVtd\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
