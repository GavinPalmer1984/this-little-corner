I've been working trying to figure out why Jordan Peterson is prompting people to reconsider religion, God, Christianity and the Bible. I think a piece of this is the way he undermines the subtraction story and makes God and faith believable once again for many people. Here I walk through the subtraction story and the ways I think Peterson's ideas can open us up to once again believe in the supernatural.\n\nMaps of Meaning 2017 8 https://youtu.be/Nb5cBkbQpGY \nMaps
