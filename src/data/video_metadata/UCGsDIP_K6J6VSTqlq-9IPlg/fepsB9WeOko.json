 "description": "If God is dead, upon what will we construct our values? Peterson develops his anthropology from Jung resisting Nietzsche's idea that we can construct our own values. Part 3 of my commentary series on the Biblical Series lectures. Yes, we're still in Prolegomena. And yes, I'll wear headphones next time. \n\nClips taken from Biblical Series 1 https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w \nJoe Rogan with Peterson and Weinstein https://youtu.be/6G59zsjM2UI \nPeterson and Sam Harris https://youtu.be/31Ud7-EkZEI \n\nHere is an example of how the Bible converses with itself. The quotation from the 10 Commandments (Visiting the sins of the father upon the children to the third and the fourth generation) gets taken up and worked through in Ezekiel 18 pt 1 https://youtu.be/EXRrc6Ew1Aw and pt2 https://youtu.be/LHy0tSlg7cY",
