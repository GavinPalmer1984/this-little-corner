 "description": "A couple of days ago I posted a video relating @John Vervaeke and @Bishop Robert Barron https://youtu.be/IbuTAQunSLY. Both John and I share a dissatisfaction with the dynamics of the current atheist/theist debate often around what I call God #1 and God #2. So we get a chance to get into these issues. This was a wonderful conversation. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
