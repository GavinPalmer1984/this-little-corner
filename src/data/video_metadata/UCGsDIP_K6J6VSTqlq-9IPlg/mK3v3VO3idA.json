This is sort of like decrying the rise of fish eating by Alaskan bear. Various and diverse forms of \"Christian Nationalism\" or even Imperialisms have been a near constant element of American religious culture. The existence of this is not a novelty. What IS a novelty is the surprise at which it is viewed by moderate to progressive evangelicals and especially the implicit variety of Christian nationalism and even imperialism by the Christian and post-Christian left. This movement is deeply imperial but many of those who promote it most strongly are blind to its imperial qualities. \n\nI'm going to list a series of books that illustrate the various nationalisms through American history, many written by George Marsden\n\nJonathan Edwards https://amzn.to/2PG3yLt\nFundamentalism and American Culture https://amzn.to/30gCgNx\nTwilight of the American Enlightenment https://amzn.to/2Org0hB\nFaiths of our Fathers https://amzn.to/3qnTi6Y\nMidnight Rising https://amzn.to/3bZXPY8\nGreat Courses American Religious History https://amzn.to/3kPaAZC\nA Great and Holy War https://amzn.to/30igN75\nJordan Peterson Ayaan Hirshi Ali https://youtu.be/yKhAh_qfO64\nJordan Peterson Gregg Hurtwitz https://youtu.be/yKhAh_qfO64\nChuck Colson Born Again https://amzn.to/3emYRAe\nRhett and Link Spiritual Journey One Year Later https://youtu.be/CnYG6x-aOTk\nThe Rest is History: Empires https://pca.st/8sq8h8f9\nDouthat Smith Burton https://youtu.be/WIttJNroGyM\nThe Benedict Option https://amzn.to/30jXvOI\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2021/01/how-the-civil-rights-movement-converted-liberal-white-protestants-to-secularism/\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU\n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
