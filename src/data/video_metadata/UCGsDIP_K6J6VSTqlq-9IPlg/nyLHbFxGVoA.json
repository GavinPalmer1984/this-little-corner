God accomplishes this for her,  but the real work is revealed to be the liberation from what is inside of her. \n\nThe commandment against coveting addresses this. We are grabbed not just by our desires but our desires of what another possesses. This puts at war against each other only stopped by the threat of violence. Jesus doesn't use this tool, but instead becomes our victim, leaving us with blood on our hands wondering how we got here. We need a stronger, positive love to pull us out and point us in the right direction. Something that will possess us, driving us away from pointless violence towards peace with neighbor and union with Christ. \n\nhttps://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/Chalmers,%20Thomas%20-%20The%20Exlpulsive%20Power%20of%20a%20New%20Af.pdf\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
