This is God #2 (after he explained God #1). The \"spirit\" we must use in times like that is Pascal's \"spirit of finesse\". This is why psychologically speaking the God who is \"holy holy holy\" is not treated as impersonal but as a person and we are best to do so. \n\nLots of material here from John Vervaeke on Kant and
