He gives some brief chapter summaries and off we go! \n\nNotes\nJames KA Smith Who\u2019s Afraid of Postmodernism\nWhat is a metanarrative? \n\u201cNot just a grand story but legitimate the story by an appeal to universal reason\u201d\nThrough faith you live into the story. The role of faith in knowing\nDerrida: there is nothing outside of the text\nThere is no seeing that isn\u2019t interpretation\nAlways seeing the text through your lenses\nThere is no text without context\nThe necessity of the interpretive community\nShapes each other to see the world as Christians see it\nThe community makes you see in the narrative\nYou can\u2019t see without interpretation\nFoucault: power is knowledge\nKnowledge and power are inextricably linked\nWhenever there is a power system it will form people into their way of seeing the world\nGets at this through a long study of the prison system\nJBP\nJesus as Christus Victor\nPrincipalities and Powers\nProtestant Reformation\nBible as a way of back to Christ instead of the church going forward\nThe end of Protestantism\nStanley Hauerwas\nHannah\u2019s Child\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes
