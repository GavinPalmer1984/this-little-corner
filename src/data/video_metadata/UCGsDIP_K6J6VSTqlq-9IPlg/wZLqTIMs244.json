 "description": "With the popularity of Jordan Peterson's \"12 Rules for Life\" there have been a spate of hit pieces done that try to undermine his credibility and his success. While engagement can be negative and even argumentative many of these pieces have been similar. https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/rights-favorite-new-intellectual-has-some-truly-pitiable-ideas-about-masculinity \n\nI was struck when rereading Alan Jacob's terrific book \"The Narnian\" how similar these efforts are to what CS Lewis battled in the 1940s until his death in 1963. https://www.amazon.com/Narnian-Life-Imagination-C-S-Lewis/dp/B000BQYRE8/\n\nHere's my conversation with Jonathan Pageau https://youtu.be/rxrtZuyPvFw",
