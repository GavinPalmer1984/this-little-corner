Religion (s) which is the secular definition of \"religion\" where people pray, go to religious services, pursue a relationship with a divine being in order to influence events on the ground. This compared to religion (w) which is more worldview. It is the coding of the culture-net, or the symbolic-dramatic-liturgical-imaginary. \n\nThe comment I read about real relations is pinned on this video. https://youtu.be/M6QmOWI2Ysw\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
