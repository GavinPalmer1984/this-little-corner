 "description": "Weston got a randos slot and wanted to present to me an idea he and his father have thrown around quite a bit. It seems to both of us a new idea about how to resolve some creation/science questions about sin, death and the fall. He absolutely admits that this is speculative and he proposes it as a sort of fresh thinking so it is given in that spirit. See what you think and let him know. He made a website with a paper presenting it. https://www.fallenearthforum.com/ \n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
