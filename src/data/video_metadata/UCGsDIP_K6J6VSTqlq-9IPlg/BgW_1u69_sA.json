 "description": "JBP famously won't say \"I believe in God\" because he doesn't want to hazard misunderstandings on \"belief\" or \"God\". He says that the way in which people act out their beliefs is more important than what they say. He isn't alone in this Jesus said similar things. Many religious traditions say similar things. Is the word \"belief\" really sufficient for this conversation? Is it helpful? \n\nPeter Boghossian \"Choosing Beliefs\" Letter 1 https://letter.wiki/conversation/22\nVervaeke Meaning Crisis 13 https://youtu.be/vGB8k7jk1AQ\nKeller Preaching to the Heart https://youtu.be/SWe1E8AMMr8\nJBP April 2019 Q/A https://youtu.be/rgivGzjZixM\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nTo support this channel/podcast on Paypal: https://paypal.me/paulvanderklay\nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin (BTC): 37TSN79RXewX8Js7CDMDRzvgMrFftutbPo \nTo support this channel/podcast with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) qr3amdmj3n2u83eqefsdft9vatnj9na0dqlzhnx80h \nTo support this channel/podcast with Ethereum (ETH): 0xd3F649C3403a4789466c246F32430036DADf6c62\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulvanderklay\n\nAlso on Lbry: https://lbry.io/ @paulvanderklay\n\nJoin the Sacramento JBP Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Jordan-Peterson-Meetup/\n\nPaul's Church Content at Living Stones Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7bdktIALZ9Nq41oVCvW-A\n\nYou can donate to Living Stones CRC to support this work here http://www.livingstonescrc.org/donate \nDonations may be tax deductible for taxpayers of the United States",
