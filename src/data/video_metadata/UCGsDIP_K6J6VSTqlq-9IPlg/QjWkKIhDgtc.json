Coleman: There's a Better Version of Yourself on the Other Side of Fear", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjWkKIhDgtc", "date": "2020-06-11", "description": "On Twitter the other day in the midst of the frenzy I posted links to some of my favorite black voices having productive conversations about race. Someone suggested I follow TK and talk to him. I am so glad that I did. This conversation was what I needed. \n\nYou can find him at https://fee.org/rev1 and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/TK_Coleman\n\nConversation notes\nJohn McWhorter\n\nFamily of 5 Chicago, Pentecostal all black church in chicago\nWashington and Cicero\nWork is distinct from a job. \nCollege on a theater scholarship\nConservative culturally but not politically\nCrisis of faith\nIntervarsity and campus crusade\nRavi Zacharias international ministries Just thinking\nWent straight to the philosophy department\nDr. Timothy McGrew\n\nWhen you get redemption wrong, you get repentance wrong\n\nThe world is a cancel culture, Christianity is a compassion culture\n\nGod's ultimate aim is to redeem them.\nThe purpose of rebuke is to understand\nRich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiasaki\nFinancial literacy and the meaning of life\nFinancial Advisor at American Express\n\nIt's not failure that people fear, but being alone when it comes time to own the consequences.\nUturn on Weed, Page kennedy\n\nAmerican Idol\n\nThe most interesting thinkers are the people who are willing to take risks\n\nPearl of great price is not a dream come true, but it is the person you get to become by being true to those dreams. \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.

There are things that you can only know by engaging reality. They use the \"will of god\" as a way of hiding. I'll use that way to give me guarantees. \n\nThe way to get stuck is to stop growing from within that position. \n\nEducation director discoverpraxis.com \n\nCriticize by creating\nApprenticeships for
