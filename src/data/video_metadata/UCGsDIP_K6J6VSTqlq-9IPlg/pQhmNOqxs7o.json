 "description": "Why is Peterson motivating people to study the Bible and consider Christianity? I think you can find answers not only what he says but how he approaches the Bible and talks about it. \n\nGoing old school with the Biblical Series Commentary. This time on Bib Ser 4 https://youtu.be/Ifi5KkXig3s \n\nNo fancy this time, just watching through and commenting on what I've learned so far from Peterson.",
