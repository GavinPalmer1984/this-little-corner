He has been the leader of the effort to found an Estuary in Germany. As you'll see it fits in with his story. \n\n1. Meetup.com group of our German Estuary\nhttps://www.meetup.com/de-DE/katakomben-kultur-mannheim\n\n(it is called Katakomben Kultur - the term Estuary does not speak immediately to Germans. Why catacomb culture? Well first of all mostly I sit in my basement when I do these online meetups. And second because of this Roger Scruton citation:\n\n\"We have entered a spiritual limbo. Our educational institutions are no longer the bearers of high culture and public life has been deliberately moronised. But here and there, sheltered from the noise and glare of the media, the old spiritual forces are at work. Popular culture contains pockets of gentleness and melody. Architects, writers and composers produce works which are neither kitsch nor \u2018kitsch\u2019. Prayer and penitence have been interrupted, but not forgotten. To those who wish for it, the ethical life may still be retrieved. Ours is a catacomb culture, a fame kept alive by undaunted monks. And what the monks of Europe achieved in a former dark age, they might achieve again.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sir Roger Scruton)\n\n2.
