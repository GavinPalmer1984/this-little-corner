 "description": "Joe comes in for a conversation. He's number 6 or 7. Homeschooled but not quite as you can imagine. \n\nParents had questions about the institutional church\nStopped going to church as a family when he was 6 of 7 years old\nStill identify as Christians. \nLooking for the kind of community looking for healing \nFather raised southern Baptist\nTerrified of God growing up. \nStarted going to church again as a teenager\nTwin Lakes church\nDidn't find the sense of belonging that every human is looking for\nWhy do I believe any of this? \nHit a point when he didn't believe any\nAll three brothers went through a deconstructive process\nThe whole propositional framework\nFreest weeks of my life. Born again but de-converted\nFrom there got into the New Atheist crowd\nWrapped up in that until JBP came on the scene\nWrestling with \"the church\" \nWhere's the body of Christ? What is it supposed to look like? Where to find it? \nThis isn't just Christianity. We're all trying to find that\u2026 What does true community look like? \nVervaeke helped integrate some of the more academic pursuits\nInternalizing the sage, who is the sage? What is the sage? \nPiece together the sage through the men he encounters? Who are the men he looks up to? \n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nVanderklips channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0jIcadtoxELSwehCh5QTg\n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
