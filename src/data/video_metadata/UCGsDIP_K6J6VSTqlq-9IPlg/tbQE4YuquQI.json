 "description": "Big, wide ranging conversation with Randos leaders Luke and Jeff. Jordan Peterson, John Vervaeke, Ian McGilchrist, CS Lewis, Church Fathers and more. \n\nPropositional truth, Vervaeke\u2019s 4 P-s John Vervaeke Ian McGilchrist Rebel Wisdom Talk https://youtu.be/JdB-BMdgFbk\n\nRandos United Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEzWTLDYmL8soRdQec9Fsjw\n\nPropositional knowledge is potential knowledge, \n\nJP Marceau with Pageau, the violence and the grace of eating food \n\nEucharistic knowledge: \n\nPropositional is meaningless until you do it\n\nOwen Barfield\n\nJohn Vervaeke and Tyler from the Discords https://youtu.be/GmGOqkHQCIk\n\nSocratic type dia-logos, not trying to win the conversation but rather the thing you want is that both people come away with more, get to a place you could not come to on  your own. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s real until trials test and reveal\n\nBuilding relationships between participants. \n\nAll models are false and some are useful\n\nSubconsciously in a mode of always winning\n\nAct-as-if conversational trinitarianism\n\nStop at the propositional level (but you can\u2019t, this itself is a proposition)\n\nDon\u2019t Cathy Newman me\u2026\n\nTrump is not the anti-christ. Sam is a unitarian\n\nWe go into quarantine mode, it\u2019s the disgust impulse, Jonathan Haidt\n\nThe map is not the territory\n\nEgoic intellect and principalities\n\nThe Propositional is Potential\n\nPageau conversation with Fr. Stephen Freeman\n\nNobody never knows anything in general but only in particular\n\nLuke sees trinity stuff everywhere\u2026\n\nMonism, Dualism and Trinitarianism\n\nIkon is an image and a portal\n\nFather John Behr \u201cis God a person\u201d \n\n\u201cPerson\u201d developed in trinitarian theology in the 4th century, Barfieldian evolution of consciousness\n\nThey carried their ancestors around with them. It was part of their identity\n\nIt was the broader, bigger thing. We\u2019re almost divorced from it. \n\nSpiral dynamics way\n\nPerelandra. Silmarillian, original participation\n\nModernity, protestantism, a bag of propositional confessions\n\nA reunion of the whole in an inter-personal way. Difference and yet unity\n\nFamily is a microcosm of everything. \n\nAbortion and viability\n\nTribal mentality, way of seeing the world where everything outside is bad and will cause harm\nHyper individuality person leaves and comes back, hero\u2019s journey\n\nHow to get both and rather than either or\n\nMaximus the confessor, the gnomic will\n\nThe mind that analyses and chooses between options. \n\nHow you can understand libertarian freedom\n\nMaximus was saying was that Jesus was such a kind that he didn\u2019t have a gnomic will. \n\nDoublemindedness. We are of two minds. \n\nAn error to impose upon Jesus. Jesus was tempted and tested. Jesus was not tempted in the way that I was tempted. \n\n\u201cUltimately all my theology comes from God and the Trinity\u201d Luke Thompson\n\nDid Jesus inherit any of the fallen nature. \n\nIdentity\n\nIs that experience required to add value to a conversation about that experience.\n\nDo we need a savior who has experienced the particulars in order to save humanity. \n\nCEO doesn\u2019t need to do an entry level position in order to fully (sufficiently) understand that position. \n\nWould Jesus need to be a disabled gay woman of color. \n\nCS Lewis essay on Equality\n\nCS Lewis membership essay, Equality is good medicine but not good food. \n\nStations which receive honor and stations that supplicate. \n\nFather David\u2019s church. \n\nEven in showing that honor we become more truly human. \n\nProposition as potential rather than reality\n\nFeel free to send content.\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
