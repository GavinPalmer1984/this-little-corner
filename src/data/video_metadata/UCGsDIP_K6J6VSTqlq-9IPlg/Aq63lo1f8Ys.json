 "description": "Continuing my exploration of the Frame Problem and God I look at an interview with Hubert Dreyfus late in his life where he offers some advice for living from Kierkegaard and Heidegger. You need a focus to your life, something to give you meaning but what can that focus be? Jordan Peterson likewise often offers meaning as a sort of compass to one's life but that alone won't insure it's a good compass. Then I use an interview that Benjamin Boyce did with James Lindsay on Social Justice Warriors and they way that they deviate from post-modernity. Your focus will become your god. CS Lewis addresses that in his book on Heaven and Hell entitled The Great Divorce. \n\nHubert Dreyfus Interview on Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Meaning https://youtu.be/u_zNHOzDP7w\nBenjamin Boyce and James Lindsay https://youtu.be/TFBWyCcwZK4\nCS LeClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
