 "description": "The Apocalyptic Jesus wraps up the Sermon on the Mount. Because of the structure the conclusion relates to the introduction more than people assume. The Introduction is poetic, the conclusion apocalyptic. How to survive the inevitable apocalypse? By doing the will of the Father. This is how Jesus survives the Day of the Lord when it comes to Him. \n\n\n\nChicago Riots https://youtu.be/U1VdhQbfSTY\nKendell Jenner Live Now Pepsi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_for_Now_(Pepsi)\nMatthew 7\n\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
