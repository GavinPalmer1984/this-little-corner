 "description": "New Atheists imagined that the recession of the church would lead to the triumph of Rationality. By Rationality they believed that people would be non-superstitious, they would deny supernatural belief and materialism would reign. Tom Holland noted that the morality of secular humanism is Christian morality. What do we really see as Christianity recedes? Many have noted the rise of old style paganism. Is paganism resurging or did it never leave? Is this simply Bret Weinstein's second track? \n\nThe Durability of Secular Humanism?
