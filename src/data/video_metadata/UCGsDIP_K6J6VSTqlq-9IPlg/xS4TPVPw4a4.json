 "description": "Marcus finally finds a slot. He's a graduate student in economics who's got interested in Jordan Peterson in college. William James is one of Peterson's sources that I haven't adequately covered so we go there and we talk about the moral philosophy of Adam Smith. His Youtube channel Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF0sWy0CRX5o8HihsNh_UiA\n\nPhilly, statistician, and phycisist\nNon denominational evangelical\nArmenian Catholic school\nHomeschooled\nFather was a libertarian\nEconomics\nGeorge mason University\nAP European history class\nMatthew Allison's channel\nLiebnitz' cosmological argument\nJoe Rogan podcast JBP says \"I'm deeply religious\" \nIn his mother's basement, playing minecraft\nPeterson was a weird rock though college\nMember of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship\nWent to an Anglican church in the area\nTwo kinds of atheism: Bertrandt Russell and Fredrick Nietzsche\nAll his friends realized they were getting into Orthodoxy\nJordan Peterson\nDan Klein, wrote an article about JBP on SSRN\nJBP's use of the word post-modern\nPOMO bashing, not the strategy\nZizek and Tyler Cowen\n\nWilliam James the Value of Saintliness\n\n\"How is success to be absolutely measured when there\u00a0are so many environments and so many ways of looking at the adaptation? It cannot be measured absolutely; the verdict will vary according to the point of view adopted. From the biological point of view Saint Paul was a failure, because he was beheaded. Yet he was magnificently adapted to the larger environment of history; and so far as any saint's example is a leaven of righteousness in the world, and draws it in the direction of more prevalent habits of saintliness, he is a success, no matter what his immediate bad fortune may be. The greatest saints, the spiritual heroes whom every one acknowledges, the Francises, Bernards, Luthers, Loyolas, Wesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the Phillips Brookses, the Agnes Joneses, Margaret Hallahans, and Dora Pattisons, are successes from the outset. They show themselves, and there is no question ; every one perceives their strength and stature. Their sense of mystery in things, their passion, their goodness, irradiate about them and enlarge their outlines while they soften them. They are like pictures with an atmosphere and background ; and, placed alongside of them, the strong men of this world and no other seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as blocks of stone or brickbats.\" (William James in the Varieties of Religious Experience)\n\nWilliam james and the pragmatists\nWilliams James: the Will to Believe\nTurn away from roots to fruits\n\nChest lettuce\n\nOrthodoxy thread \n\nAdam Smith: the Theory of Moral Sentiments \nDas Adam Smith problem\nAdam Smith the Moral Philosopher\nRelated to sympathy\nRuns counter to atomic-individualism\nEven then you're alone, there's another person inside yourself, the man within the breast\nThe impartial spectator\nYou have to straddle these two things\nThe real goal is to sympathize with the impartial spectator, who is impartial to the whole of reality\nRules to guide us. \nThe virtue of thrift. Me today, me tomorrow, \nImpartial spectator cares about both me today and me tomorrow. \nPiaget equilibrated self. \nThe invisible hand\nAs if by an invisible hand he's lead to benevolence\nThe invisible hand is both selfish and non-selfish\nDan Klein\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/jdVk8XU \n\nIf you want to schedule a one-on-one conversation check here. https://paulvanderklay.me/2019/08/06/converzations-with-pvk/\n\nFor the audio podcast mirror on Podbean http://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/\n\nTo listen to this on ITunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-vanderklays-podcast/id1394314333 \n\nIf you need the RSS feed for your podcast player https://paulvanderklay.podbean.com/feed/ \n\nAll Amazon links here are part of the Amazon Affiliate Program.
