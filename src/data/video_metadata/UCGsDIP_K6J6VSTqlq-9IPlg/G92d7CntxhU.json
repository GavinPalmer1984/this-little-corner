 "description": "Warren Mills from Melbourne AU is back with questions for me this time. Here are the questions he sent. \n\nHow has the JBP phenomenon changed you?\nWhat remains as the central message of Jesus?\nWhat is your legacy to your Internet audience?\nWhat are you looking forward to most?\nWhat advice do you have for your Christian and non Christian audience?\nWhat role should the church play in the next 50 years?\n\nWe didn't get to them all. We talked about his book on the Golden Rule and other things too. https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Good-is-Golden-Rule-Warren-Mills/9780648497769 \n\nGolden rule is a learning tool\nThe sermon on the mount and human flourishing Jonathan pennington https://amzn.to/2Daik3j\nWhat is love\nRobert Barron\nDon Garlits King of the Dragsters https://amzn.to/33deLnX\n\nWalter Wink\nThe inward journey, the interiority of our being, measured against our relationship with God. that sense of encounter and accountability. Our external journey, our relationship with others. \nAlfred North Whitehead \nFirst the natural then the spiritual\nInstinctive drives, treating ourselves as being valuable, not just to ourselves but to God and to others. Trying to understand what the highest good is that we should pursue. \nLeads us into a symbiotic relationship of inward and outward. If we seek God we will find him. \nMaking things with his hands and writing\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/WkkHMTt The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
