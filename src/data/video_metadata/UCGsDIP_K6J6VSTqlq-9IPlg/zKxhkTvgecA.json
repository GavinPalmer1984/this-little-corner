 "description": "The first videos I made on Jordan Peterson were commentaries on his Biblical Series. These sort of got the channel going. My videos were very much a learning process for me and as the JBP movement kept developing and followed that path of my learning. People regularly mention these videos and I've felt badly that I didn't keep up with them. I thought of picking it up where I left off but I've learned a lot since then so I figured I'd start over.
