 "description": "It is clear that there are competing understandings of the word \"religion\", not only today between competing groups but also throughout history. Bret Weinstein mentions his color as \"metaphorical truth\" to Sam Harris from the Jim Rutt show. Tom Holland in an older video (with poor sounds, sorry) walks through the development of the concept as of Christian history in the Middle ages. While the British failed to share confessional Christianity with its subjects it nevertheless created the concept of \"religion\" that implicitly framed the concept in a way that transformed the world. This framing deeply impacts the contemporary Christian/atheist conversations in ways we mostly glide over. \n\nBret Weinstein and Sam Harris https://youtu.be/id6AqKIxd94\nBret Weinstein and the Jim Rutt Show https://www.jimruttshow.com/bret-weinstein/\nBret Weinstein and Alister McGrath Unbelievable https://youtu.be/kRx2uNMJFnU\nDaniel Bonevac Manifest Image https://youtu.be/aVoWTnpF5ew\nSoul Searching by Christian Smith https://amzn.to/2tQFVot\nTom Holland Glen Scrivener https://youtu.be/a0xCs2EfiXA\nTom Holland Classics Club https://youtu.be/ZeCTC_r4vMI\n\nClick here to meetup with other channel viewers for conversation https://discord.gg/2uUhZBK The link will prompt you to download the software for this free group messaging service.
