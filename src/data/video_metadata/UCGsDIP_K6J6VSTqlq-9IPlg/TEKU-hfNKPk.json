He needed something for the computer monitors to play so he stripped these clips from the channel without sound. I think they make sort of a nice montage of the channel. No sounds, just faces talking. No audio version of this one of course. :) Enjoy.  \n\nThank you to each who have come to this channel over the years whether or not you made Rik's cut.", "duration": 553, "transcript_parts": []}
