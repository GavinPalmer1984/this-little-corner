 "description": "1 Thessalonians gives us a much desired window into the life of the very early church. This isn't an account from the outside like we get from Luke in Acts. This is one side of a very loving exchange about a church born in conflict. There are issues though in terms of us understanding Paul's nomenclature. Who are \"Jews\"? Who are \"Greek Godfearers\"? What is this \"wrath\" that Paul keeps referring to and how does that relate to the grace of God and the love within the body?\n\nDiscord link. Good for just a few days.
