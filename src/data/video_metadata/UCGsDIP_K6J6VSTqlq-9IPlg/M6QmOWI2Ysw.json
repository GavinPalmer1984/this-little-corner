interest in questions of ethics\nDoes good exist, what is it? \nMath and computer science\nAt least making progress in math and science\nPhilosophy didn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere\nGodel\u2019s incompleteness theorems\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems\nThen moved into Philosophy\nThesis of masters was the hard problem of consciousness\nWas a hard physicalist\nVervaeke\nOntology of real relations\nhttp://www.philosophy-index.com/jackson/marys-room/ \nMary\u2019s room\nPan psychism\nThe hard problem of consciousness\nZombie nightmares when he was working on this\nWrestling with nihilism\n90% fewer zombie nightmares\nEthics\nAround that time learned about Jordan Peterson, John Vervaeke, Jonathan Haidt\nWe need to construct morality with the environment, in trial and error\nZombie night mares diminish\nPhilosophy causes and can reduce zombie nightmares\nStarted going back to a RC church\nAs a way to develop virtue\nTry to embody the story\nWhat God could mean philosophically\nTalked to Jonathan Pageau about the zombie nightmares\nSymbolic solution to the zombie nightmares\nWhat would Jesus do in a zombie apocalypse\nHelps to see young people in the RC\nMet four people who were philosophy students\nPeople are very hungry to talk philosophy in church\nPanpsychism of a book\nPeople didn\u2019t want to do metaphysics for a long time\nCausal closure of the physical", "duration": 3085, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "well why don't why don't you tell me a", "start": 0.8, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "little bit about yourself
