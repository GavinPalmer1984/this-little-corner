 "date": "2021-04-15",
 "description": "Today I have a chat with my friend Austinn (yes, two n's) about why he decided to start asking questions on Facebook. For the past year or so he's been sending out a variety of questions to his FB friends, some serious, some light-hearted. We chat about his inspiration for this \"project\" and then discuss one of the questions he asked previously. It led to a really interesting about church attendance, deconstruction and what makes people stay religious. I hope you enjoy!",
