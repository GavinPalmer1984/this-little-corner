 "description": "Today I have a conversation with one of my frequent commentors, Elliot. Elliot spent some time watching my videos and asked to have a one on one conversation with me and it was very enjoyable! The conversation explored a lot of different topics from belief in God, deconstruction, ideas about hell and the existence of ghosts. I hope you all enjoy it as well!\n\nLinks to Elliot's work: Linktr.ee/secularrarity\n\nInformation Addict Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/theinfoaddict",
